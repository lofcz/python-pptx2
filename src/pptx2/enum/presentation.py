    Each member maps to a single child element of ``<p:transition>``. Members
    drawn from the PowerPoint 2010+ extension namespace (``p14``) are
    annotated as such; their XML lives in the ``p14`` namespace and is
    silently preserved on round-trip even when the consuming application
    cannot render them.

    The ``xml_value`` of each member is the local-name of the corresponding
    transition element (``"fade"`` for ``<p:fade/>``, ``"morph"`` for
    ``<p14:morph/>``, etc.). Consumers should not rely on the integer values
    for anything other than enum-membership comparisons.
