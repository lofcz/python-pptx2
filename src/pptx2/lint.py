"""Slide and deck linter — detects layout/typographic issues on generated slides.

Public entry point::

    report = slide.lint()              # SlideLintReport
    report.issues                      # list[LintIssue]
    report.has_errors                  # bool
    report.summary()                   # human-readable string
    report.auto_fix()                  # mutates; returns list of fix descriptions

Issue types:

* ``TextOverflow``             — text likely exceeds the text-frame bounds.
* ``ShapeCollision``           — two shapes' bounding boxes overlap.
* ``OffSlide``                 — a shape extends outside the slide.
* ``MinFontSize``              — a text run is below the legibility threshold.
* ``OffGridDrift``             — shape is slightly off a column/row grid that
  several siblings hit cleanly.
* ``LowContrast``              — text/background contrast is below WCAG AA.
* ``ZOrderAnomaly``            — a filled card-shaped backdrop is drawn above
  shapes it visually contains.
* ``MasterPlaceholderCollision`` — a shape sits exactly on a placeholder it
  should likely have inherited from the layout.
* ``LayerOrderViolation``      — a shape declares ``layer_above`` but is drawn
  below the layer it claims to sit on top of.

Declaring intentional overlap (so the collision detector stays quiet)::

    badge.lint_group = "card-1"           # n-ary: everything sharing a tag
    badge.allow_overlap_with(card)        # pairwise: exactly this one pair
    card.layer, badge.layer_above = "card", "card"   # asserts z-order too

        the residual punch list is just ``report.issues`` rather than a
        second ``slide.lint()`` call.

        Currently auto-fixable:

        * ``OffSlide``     — clamps the shape on-slide.  Shrinks the
          width / height first when the shape is larger than the slide
          (translation alone can't fix that), then nudges position
          inside the bounds.  Each shape is clamped at most once even
          when it triggered multiple OffSlide issues (e.g. left + right).
        * ``OffGridDrift`` — snaps the shape's drifted edge onto the dominant
          grid line (Tier 3 of the auto-fix tier list).
        * ``TextOverflow`` — flips the offending text frame's auto-size
          setting to ``MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` so PowerPoint
          shrinks the runs at render time.  This is a non-destructive
          fix: the text content is preserved verbatim, only the
          render-time sizing changes.  Frames that already have a
          non-NONE auto-size are skipped (they should not have linted
          in the first place).

        * ``LayerOrderViolation`` — restacks the shape that declared
          ``layer_above`` to sit immediately after the layer it named, so
          the drawing order matches the declaration.  Unlike the
          collision fixes below this needs no designer judgment: the
          author already stated which shape belongs on top, and the fix
          only makes the z-order say the same thing.  Geometry is
          untouched.

        Not auto-fixable:

        * ``ShapeCollision`` — nudging shapes apart almost always breaks intent;
