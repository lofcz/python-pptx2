"""Read-only accessibility audit for a generated deck.

Decks produced programmatically routinely ship without the metadata a
screen reader needs — pictures with no alt text, slides with no title,
text whose contrast against its fill falls below WCAG AA.  These slip
past the layout linter (the deck *looks* fine) but make the result
unusable for assistive technology.

:func:`audit_accessibility` walks every slide and shape and returns a
small structured :class:`AccessibilityReport` so an agent that builds a
deck can answer "is this accessible?" without crawling the slides by
hand::

    from pptx2 import accessibility

    report = accessibility.audit_accessibility(prs)
    print(report.markdown())
    if report.has_errors:
        ...

The audit is strictly read-only — it never mutates the deck.

Issue codes:

* ``MissingAltText``   — a picture or other meaningful shape carries no
  ``alt_text`` (``<p:cNvPr descr=...>``).  Pictures are ERROR (a screen
  reader has nothing to announce); other meaningful shapes are WARNING.
* ``LowContrast``      — text-on-fill contrast is below WCAG AA (4.5:1),
  reusing the contrast math from :mod:`pptx2.lint`.
* ``NoSlideTitle``     — a slide has no (non-empty) title, so it has no
  landmark for navigation.
