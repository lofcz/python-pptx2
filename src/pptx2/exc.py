    :meth:`~pptx2.text.text.TextFrame.fit_text` measures with real font
    metrics, so its "text will not overflow" guarantee only holds when the
    requested family is actually installed.  When it isn't, measurement falls
    back to Pillow's bundled default font and the chosen size becomes a best
    guess — usually close, but not something to trust for a display face.

    Pass ``strict=True`` to raise instead, or install the font (see
    :func:`pptx2.text.fonts.font_is_installed`).
