"""Sections API — named groupings of slides in the slide-sorter/outline pane.

Sections are stored as a PowerPoint-2010 extension on the presentation part
(``p:presentation/p:extLst/p:ext[@uri="{521415D9-...}"]/p14:sectionLst``).  A
section references its member slides by their numeric ``p:sldId/@id`` value
(not the relationship id).

The public entry point is :attr:`pptx2.presentation.Presentation.sections`,
which returns a :class:`Sections` collection.  Typical use::

    prs.sections.add("Intro", start_slide_index=0)
    prs.sections.add("Body", start_slide_index=2)
    for section in prs.sections:
        print(section.name, [s.slide_id for s in section.slides])
