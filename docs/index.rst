Release v\ |version| (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

.. include:: ../README.rst


Philosophy
----------

|pp| aims to broadly support the PowerPoint format (PPTX, PowerPoint 2007 and
later), but its primary commitment is to be *industrial-grade*, that is,
suitable for use in a commercial setting. Maintaining this robustness requires
a high engineering standard which includes a comprehensive two-level (e2e +
unit) testing regimen and a round-trip regression harness that locks in every
new feature.


Feature support
---------------

|pp| has the following capabilities:

* Round-trip any Open XML presentation (.pptx file) including all its elements
* Add slides, populate text placeholders, add images, textboxes, tables, auto
  shapes (polygons, flowchart shapes, etc.), and column / bar / line / pie
  charts at arbitrary positions and sizes
* Access and change core document properties such as title and subject
* Apply visual effects (shadows, glow, soft edges, blur, reflection) and
  alpha-tinted colors via non-mutating proxies on every shape
* Author entrance, exit, emphasis, and motion-path animations using a small
  preset library; apply per-slide and deck-wide transitions including Morph
* Read and write the active theme's color scheme and major/minor fonts;
  apply a theme imported from a ``.potx``
* Compose presentations from a JSON spec — including free-standing shapes
  with declared overlap intent — import slides between decks, and apply a
  template to existing slides
* Run a layout linter on each slide to detect text overflow, off-slide
  shapes, and shape collisions; auto-fix clamps off-slide shapes,
  resolves text overflow, snaps grid drift, and restacks contradicted
  layer declarations, with ``lint_on_save`` to gate the whole deck
* Build with a design-token system, opinionated slide recipes, and ``Grid`` /
  ``Stack`` layout primitives
* Recolor charts from named palettes and toggle title / legend / axis-label
  / gridline visibility through quick-layout presets
* Render slide thumbnails through LibreOffice when one is on ``$PATH``

Even with all that, the PowerPoint document format is very rich and there are
still features |pp| does not support — see ``ROADMAP.md`` for what is
planned and what is intentionally out of scope.
