Package kernel (``pptx2.package``)
=================================

*paper-pptx addition.* Compare ``.pptx`` packages semantically and save edits narrowly.
Comparison reports changes part by part. A narrow save lets only changed parts differ
from the original.

Comparison treats structural whitespace between elements as noise but preserves meaningful text
whitespace, including trailing spaces inside text runs.
