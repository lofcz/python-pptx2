Release History
---------------

This project was forked from `scanny/python-pptx`_ at version 1.0.2.
Releases prior to 1.1.0 are upstream history, preserved here verbatim and
attributed to Steve Canny and the original contributors. Releases from
1.1.0 through 2.12.x were published as ``power-pptx`` (import
``power_pptx``) by Daniel Halwell. Starting with 2.13.0 this line is
published as ``python-pptx2`` on PyPI and imported as ``pptx2``, so it
can sit beside both ``python-pptx`` (``pptx``) and ``power-pptx``
(``power_pptx``).

2.19.0 (2026-08-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

Added
.....

* **Agent-friendly kwargs, everywhere.** The alias/fuzzy normalization
  introduced for ``add_text`` now covers the whole shape-creation
  surface via a reusable ``@agent_friendly`` decorator: ``add_shape``
  (``shape_type=``), ``add_picture`` / ``add_svg_picture`` /
  ``add_movie`` (``image=`` / ``video=``), ``add_table``
  (``columns=``), ``add_chart`` (``data=``, ``width=``/``height=`` for
  ``cx``/``cy``), ``add_textbox``, ``add_connector`` (``x1/y1/x2/y2``),
  ``add_group_shape``, ``add_ole_object``, and the six diagram recipes
  (``items=`` / ``stages=`` / ``nodes=`` / ``colour=`` ...). All of
  them accept ``x``/``y``/``w``/``h`` geometry keywords, substitute
  synonyms without allowing contradictions, and raise ``TypeErrors``
  that list every accepted argument.


2.18.0 (2026-08-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

Added
.....

* **Agent-friendly kwargs** on the one-call helpers. ``add_text()``,
  ``add_equation()``, and ``add_arrow()`` now absorb cross-library
  keyword spellings — matplotlib's ``ha`` / ``va`` / ``fontsize`` /
  ``fontfamily``, CSS-flavored ``halign`` / ``text_color``, British
  ``colour``, ``x`` / ``y`` / ``w`` / ``h`` geometry keywords,
  ``begin`` / ``to`` arrow endpoints, and more — plus unambiguous
  near-misses (``algn`` → ``align``). Synonyms substitute, never
  contradict: two different values for the same logical argument still
  raise. A genuinely unknown kwarg raises a ``TypeError`` that lists
  every accepted argument, so a model reading the traceback
  self-corrects in one step.


2.17.0 (2026-08-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

Added
.....

* ``add_text()`` / ``add_equation()`` accept ``font_family`` and
  ``valign`` as aliases for ``font`` and ``anchor`` (with ``"mid"``
  now a valid anchor token). Code generators trained on matplotlib
  habitually reach for the longer spellings and died with
  ``TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'font_family'``; passing
  both an alias and its canonical with *different* values still
  raises.

* The audit font-warning safe-list now recognizes the **Aptos**
  family — the Microsoft 365 default theme fonts since 2024 — and
  merges the ``PPTX2_SAFE_FONTS`` environment variable (comma- or
  semicolon-separated) into the safe-list on every ``audit()`` call,
  so a rendering environment can declare its font inventory once
  instead of every caller passing ``extra_safe_fonts``.


2.16.0 (2026-08-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

Added
.....

* ``audit(..., extra_safe_fonts=[...])`` — the font-warning probe now
  accepts additional fonts to treat as safe (case-insensitive), on top
  of the built-in common Windows/macOS/Office list. For rendering
  environments that genuinely ship a font the built-in list doesn't
  know — e.g. a Linux sandbox whose font policy standardizes on
  ``DejaVu Sans`` — this keeps the audit signal instead of drowning it
  in per-slide warnings.


2.15.0 (2026-08-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

Twelve ports from the upstream ``scanny/python-pptx`` pull-request
backlog, triaged against this fork's existing surface: four correctness
fixes (notes-master registration, ``.potx`` opening, MPO images,
``PathLike`` inputs) and eight features (``add_paragraph(text=...)``,
``get_by_name()`` on shape collections, doughnut first-slice angle,
``Slides.remove()``, table row/column add & remove, custom document
properties, slide-number/date fields, slide-layout authoring).

Added
.....

* ``TextFrame.add_paragraph()`` accepts an optional ``text`` argument.
  When given, the new paragraph carries that text as a single run
  (``add_paragraph("Hello")`` is equivalent to ``add_paragraph()``
  followed by setting ``.text``); when omitted, an empty paragraph is
  added exactly as before (upstream feature by kckaiwei,
  ``scanny/python-pptx#602``).
* ``get_by_name(name, default=None)`` on shape collections
  (``slide.shapes``, layout/master/notes shape trees, group shapes, and
  placeholder collections via ``_BaseShapes``) — returns the first
  shape whose ``name`` matches, or ``default`` when none does
  (port of `scanny/python-pptx#798`_ by lthamm).

.. _`scanny/python-pptx#798`: https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx/pull/798
* ``DoughnutPlot.first_slice_angle`` — read/write angle in degrees
  (0–359) of the first doughnut slice, mapped to the
  ``<c:firstSliceAng>`` element. ``CategoryChartData.first_slice_angle``
  bakes the angle into charts created with ``add_chart``; the plot
  property also works on charts opened from a file.
* ``prs.slides.remove(slide)`` — delete a slide from the presentation,
  accepting either the |Slide| object or its integer slide id (upstream's
  ``remove_slide`` signature). Purges ``p14:section`` membership and drops
  the presentation→slide relationship so the slide part (and its notes
  slide) fall out of the saved package. Raises ``ValueError`` for a slide
  not in the collection. Removing the last slide yields a valid, empty
  deck.
* ``table.rows.add_row()`` / ``table.rows.remove(row_or_idx)`` and
  ``table.columns.add_column(width=None)`` /
  ``table.columns.remove(col_or_idx)`` — grow and shrink an existing
  table. A new row/column copies the height/width and cell formatting
  of the last row/column and arrives empty and unmerged; removal keeps
  the one-``a:tc``-per-``a:gridCol`` invariant, resizes the graphic
  frame, and raises ``ValueError`` rather than truncate a merged cell
  spanning multiple rows/columns. Port of scanny/python-pptx#399 by
  Ignisor.
* ``prs.custom_properties`` — mapping-style read/write access to the
  user-defined document properties in ``/docProps/custom.xml``.
  ``get``/``set``/``delete`` with ``str``, ``int``, ``float``, and
  ``bool`` values (stored as ``vt:lpstr``, ``vt:i4``, ``vt:r8``, and
  ``vt:bool``); the part and its package-root relationship are created
  lazily by the first assignment, and files that already carry a
  custom-properties part open mapped to the new part class. Port of
  ``scanny/python-pptx#342`` by stadlerism.
* ``SlideLayouts.add_layout()`` appends a blank slide layout to a slide
  master, named ``"Layout %s"`` by default (the ``%s`` is substituted with
  the new master-to-layout relationship id). ``SlideLayouts.clone()``
  deep-copies an existing layout of the same presentation — placeholders,
  shapes, and referenced images included — under a non-colliding name, and
  ``LayoutShapes.add_placeholder()`` adds a placeholder to a layout,
  defaulting its idx to the matching master placeholder so inheritance and
  ``slide.shapes.title`` keep working.


Fixed
.....

* Creating a notes master (``prs.notes_master`` on a deck without one,
  e.g. the default template) related the new part but never wrote the
  matching ``p:notesMasterIdLst`` / ``p:notesMasterId`` entry into
  ``presentation.xml``, so PowerPoint could flag the saved file for
  repair. The id list is now registered on creation and reconciled on
  access for decks saved by older versions (port of
  scanny/python-pptx#1128 by robbybrodie).
* ``@lazyproperty`` now caches a getter that legitimately returns
  ``None``. The instance-cache hit test compared the cached value to
  ``None``, so a ``None``-returning getter was silently re-evaluated on
  every access, contradicting the decorator's documented evaluate-once
  guarantee. The check is now key presence in the host object's
  ``__dict__`` (upstream fix by Afonso Januário,
  ``fix/lazyproperty-none-value-caching``).
* MPO-encoded JPEG images (multi-picture object files common from
  cameras, ``.mpo``) are accepted by ``add_picture()`` and
  ``Image.from_file()`` instead of raising ``ValueError: unsupported
  image format``. Pillow reports these as format ``MPO``; they are
  mapped to the canonical ``jpg`` extension and ``image/jpeg``
  content type (port of scanny/python-pptx#1075 by riparuk).
* ``Presentation()`` now opens ``.potx`` template files. The main-document
  part check only accepted the presentation and macro-enabled presentation
  content types, so a template package raised ``ValueError``; the
  ``presentationml.template.main+xml`` type is now accepted as well (port
  of scanny/python-pptx#1071 by 9021007).
* ``os.PathLike`` inputs (e.g. ``pathlib.Path``) are now accepted
  wherever a file path was: ``Presentation()`` open and ``save()``,
  ``Image.from_file()``, ``shapes.add_picture()``, and picture-placeholder
  ``insert_picture()``. Previously a ``Path`` raised ``TypeError`` from
  ``Image.from_file()`` and was misrouted as a stream by the package
  reader. No behavior change for ``str`` or file-like inputs (port of
  `scanny/python-pptx#1123`_ by AlexanderWillner).

.. _`scanny/python-pptx#1123`: https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx/pull/1123


2.14.0 (2026-08-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

PowerPoint-valid native equations. The MathML → OMML step is now a
bundled port of ``mathml2omml-plus`` (ECMA-376 §7.1) instead of the
PyPI ``mathml2omml`` 0.0.2 toy, which wrapped every construct in
``m:box`` and omitted ``m:fPr`` — PowerPoint then flattened fractions
to concatenated digits (``7/10`` → ``710``). Slides now declare the
``m`` / ``a14`` / ``mc`` host namespaces and ``mc:Ignorable="a14"``.

Added
.....

* ``Paragraph.add_field()`` appends slide-number and date/time fields
  (``a:fld``) to a paragraph, with the new ``MSO_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE``
  enumeration covering the ``slidenum`` / ``datetime*`` tokens. Fields are
  created with the schema-required braced GUID ``id`` and a cached-text
  (``a:t``) placeholder PowerPoint replaces with the computed value at
  render time; ``_Field`` exposes ``type``, ``text``, and ``font``.
* **Bundled ``pptx2.mathml2omml``** — spec-compliant ``m:f`` / ``m:rad``
  / ``m:nary`` / ``m:sSub`` / matrices / accents. ``python-pptx2[math]``
  now only needs ``latex2mathml``.
* Fraction bars and other controls inherit ``size_pt`` / ``color`` via
  ``m:ctrlPr`` as well as ``m:r``.

2.13.0 (2026-08-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

First release under the ``python-pptx2`` / ``pptx2`` names — a fork of
``power-pptx`` 2.12 with native PowerPoint equations from LaTeX. The
library still does not compile math itself — ``latex2mathml`` turns
the fragment into MathML and ``mathml2omml`` turns that into Office
Math, which we wrap in the ``a14:m`` marker PowerPoint actually stores.

Added
.....

* **``slide.shapes.add_equation(...)``.** Same bbox / ``(left, top,
  width, height)`` calling convention as ``add_text``, plus
  ``latex=r"\frac{a}{b}"``. Optional ``size_pt`` / ``color`` / ``font``
  / ``align`` / ``anchor``. The equation is editable in PowerPoint's
  equation editor.
* **``paragraph.add_math(latex)``.** Inline OMML between ordinary runs,
  so a sentence can contain a formula without a second shape.
* **``pptx2.math.latex_to_omml``** for callers that only need the
  ``<m:oMath>`` fragment. Missing converters raise
  ``MathBackendUnavailable`` with the install line.

Install the converters with ``pip install "python-pptx2[math]"``.


2.12.0 (2026-08-24)
+++++++++++++++++++

Completes Phase 2 of the roadmap — the space-awareness phase this fork
exists for. The linter could already tell you two shapes overlap; it had
no way to be told the overlap was the point. Both remaining Phase 2
items ship here.

Added
.....

* **Declaring intentional overlaps.** ``ShapeCollision`` is the noisiest
  rule, because deliberate layering looks exactly like a copy-paste bug
  from a bounding box alone. Until now the only way to say "I meant
  that" was ``shape.lint_group``, which is n-ary and symmetric — every
  shape sharing the tag may overlap every other. Two narrower forms join
  it:

  * ``shape_a.allow_overlap_with(shape_b)`` licenses exactly one pair
    and leaves every other overlap policed. It is written one-sided but
    read symmetrically: either shape vouching for the pair is enough.
    Paired with ``disallow_overlap_with()`` and an
    ``overlap_allowances`` property (a ``frozenset`` of shape ids).
  * ``shape.layer`` / ``shape.layer_above`` declare a stratum of the
    design and, uniquely, assert a *direction*. A shape declaring
    ``layer_above = "card"`` claims to be painted on top of every
    overlapping shape whose ``layer`` is ``"card"``.

  Both round-trip through save/open in the shape's ``cNvPr/extLst``, the
  OOXML-sanctioned extension point, alongside the existing ``lint_group``
  and ``lint_skip``.

* **Free-standing shapes in a ``from_spec`` spec.** A slide entry may
  now carry a ``shapes`` list — ``left`` / ``top`` / ``width`` /
  ``height`` (inches or ``Length``), plus ``name``, ``shape`` (an
  ``MSO_SHAPE`` member name) and ``text`` — applied after the layout
  runs. Deliberately minimal: geometry, type, text, intent, not a
  drawing DSL.

* **Overlap intent is declarable in a spec.** Shape entries accept
  ``lint_group``, ``layer``, ``layer_above`` and ``allow_overlap_with``,
  so a generator can state at authoring time that an overlap is
  deliberate and the built deck lints clean without a manual pass.
  ``allow_overlap_with`` names other shapes by their spec ``name`` —
  shape ids don't exist until the deck is built — and is resolved once
  every shape on the slide exists, so forward references work. Names
  must be unique within a slide and references may not cross slides,
  since an allowance is keyed on a shape id and ids are only unique per
  slide; both raise a ``ValueError`` locating the entry.

* **``LayerOrderViolation``** — a new ERROR-severity lint issue, and the
  reason layer hints are more than a third way to silence a warning.
  When a shape's ``layer_above`` declaration is contradicted by the
  drawing order — it claims to be on top but comes earlier in ``spTree``
  and is painted underneath — the declaration is taken as what the
  author meant and the z-order is reported as the bug. Non-overlapping
  pairs are inert, not wrong.

* ``LayerOrderViolation`` is **auto-fixable**: ``report.auto_fix()``
  restacks the declaring shape to sit immediately after the layer it
  named. Unlike the collision rules this needs no designer judgment —
  the author already stated which shape belongs on top, and the fix only
  makes the drawing order agree. Geometry is never touched.
  ``slide.tidy()`` picks it up via a new ``fix_layer_order=True``
  keyword.

Fixed
.....

* PyPI project links. ``Documentation`` pointed at a Read the Docs site
  this project does not publish to; it now points at the GitHub Pages
  site the README and badges already used. ``Changelog`` and ``Roadmap``
  pointed at ``/blob/main/`` paths, but the default branch is ``master``
  and no ``main`` branch exists, so both returned 404. All eight project
  URLs now resolve.

* Deleting a shape left overlap allowances pointing at its id. Ids are
  recycled — the allocator hands out ``max(existing) + 1`` — so deleting
  the highest-id shape freed its id for the next shape added after a
  save/reopen, and the stale allowance then matched that unrelated
  newcomer and silently suppressed a real ``ShapeCollision``.
  ``shape.delete()`` now purges allowances naming it, alongside the
  animation-timing cleanup it already did — including every id nested
  inside a deleted group, since removing a group's element removes its
  members with it and an allowance may legitimately name one.

* ``shape.allow_overlap_with(...)`` accepted a shape from another slide.
  Allowances are keyed on ``cNvPr/@id``, which is unique only *within* a
  slide, so a borrowed id either collided with the source shape's own id
  — surfacing as a bogus "cannot be given an overlap allowance with
  itself" error — or silently matched an unrelated shape on this slide
  and suppressed a collision that was real. Both the grant and the
  revoke now reject a cross-slide target with a ``ValueError`` that says
  why, matching the guard the spec-based reference path already had.

* Setting a single dimension on a placeholder that was still inheriting
  its geometry silently zeroed the other one. ``left``/``top`` share an
  ``<a:off>`` element and ``width``/``height`` share an ``<a:ext>``, so
  writing one materialised the element with its sibling defaulted to
  ``0`` — ``body.width = Inches(4)`` collapsed the height from 4.95in to
  nothing and made the shape invisible, with no warning. The inherited
  sibling is now copied across first, so a single-dimension assignment
  means what it reads as: change this one, leave the other where the
  layout put it. An explicit zero is still honoured.

* ``Slide.follow_master_background``'s docstring described assigning
  |True| / |False| to it, but the property has no setter and any
  assignment raises ``AttributeError``. It now documents the real
  mechanism: inheritance breaks as a side-effect of giving the slide its
  own ``background``.

* Writing any lint marker other than ``lint_group`` — a ``lint_skip``
  set, and now a layer name or an overlap allowance — silently discarded
  a ``lint_group`` stored in the pre-2.1.1 attribute format, including on
  paths documented as no-ops. The legacy value is now migrated into the
  canonical ``<pp:lintGroup>`` node instead of being dropped.

* ``SlideLintReport.auto_fix(dry_run=True)`` could report more layer
  restacks than a real run would apply, because the one-move-per-shape
  guard was only populated outside dry-run mode. A preview now lists
  exactly the fixes the real run performs.

Added
.....

* ``prs.lint_on_save`` — a save-time validation hook. ``"off"`` (the
  default, so existing code is unaffected and pays nothing) skips all
  checks; ``"warn"`` lints every slide and logs each error-severity issue
  on the ``power_pptx.presentation`` logger before writing the file;
  ``"raise"`` lints before anything is written and raises
  ``power_pptx.exc.LintError`` naming the offending slide indexes, so a
  failing deck never reaches disk. Only error-severity issues trigger it,
  matching the ``lint`` option of ``power_pptx.compose.from_spec``. Any
  other value raises ``ValueError``. The setting is not persisted into the
  ``.pptx`` file.

2.11.0 (2026-08-21)
+++++++++++++++++++

An ergonomics release from dogfooding the library on a real nine-slide
deck: the shadow that would not turn off, corner radius spelled as a
fraction, column arithmetic written out by hand, table styling that
dropped back to raw python-pptx, and a text fit that quietly guessed
when the brand font was missing.

Added
.....

* Documentation site under ``site/`` — Astro + TypeScript + React with
  shadcn-style UI primitives and MUI islands, deployed to GitHub Pages
  via ``.github/workflows/pages.yml``. Covers the starter guide,
  advanced usage, coding-agent (skill) usage, and the full API surface,
  with a light-by-default theme and a persisted dark-mode toggle.
* ``README.rst`` gained a header block with PyPI / Python-version / CI /
  license / docs badges and a library-information table linking the new
  documentation pages.
* ``shape.shadow.clear()`` — one call that guarantees a shape renders with
  no shadow. It drops every explicit shadow element *and* re-points the
  shape's ``<a:effectRef>`` at the theme's empty effect slot, which is what
  clearing the individual properties never did: auto shapes ship with
  ``<a:effectRef idx="2"/>``, a soft drop shadow in most themes, so a
  "cleared" card kept a phantom shadow. Non-shadow effects (glow, soft
  edges, blur, reflection) are preserved, and a shape whose effects are
  an ``<a:effectDag>`` has its shadow nodes pruned from that tree rather
  than gaining a schema-invalid sibling ``<a:effectLst>``.
* ``shape.corner_radius`` on rounded-rectangle auto shapes — read/write in
  length units (``card.corner_radius = Pt(6)``) instead of the raw
  ``adjustments[0]`` fraction-of-the-shorter-side, so corner radius can be
  specified the way it is designed. Raises rather than silently clipping
  when the radius exceeds half the shorter side.
* ``BBox.columns(n, gap=...)`` / ``BBox.rows(n, gap=...)`` — the n-up
  shorthand for the ``(available - (n - 1) * gap) / n`` arithmetic every
  card row and stat grid would otherwise hand-roll. Widths partition the
  box exactly, with no rounding drift on the last column.
* ``Grid.from_box(box, cols=..., rows=...)`` — a ``design.layout.Grid``
  over an arbitrary region (a ``BBox``, ``Box``, or 4-tuple) rather than
  the whole slide, so a panel can carry its own grid with no slide
  reference.
* ``cell.format(...)`` and ``table.format_cells(rows=..., cols=..., ...)``
  — fill plus text styling for table cells in the same keyword vocabulary
  as ``shapes.add_text`` (``fill``, ``color``, ``bold``, ``size_pt``,
  ``align``, ``anchor``, ``margin``), replacing loops over
  ``cell.fill.fore_color.rgb``. Selections accept an int, a slice, an
  iterable of indices, or ``None`` for all; the anchor and insets are
  written to ``<a:tcPr>`` where PowerPoint actually reads them, and the
  text styling is recorded in the cell's ``<a:lstStyle>`` text-body
  defaults as well as on its runs, so styling a header row *before*
  populating it survives the later ``cell.text`` assignment.
* ``power_pptx.text.fonts.find_font_file()``, ``font_is_installed()``, and
  ``installed_font_families()`` — check up front whether a build
  environment can measure a font, instead of discovering it from a
  render.
* ``TextFrame.fit_text()`` now returns the point size it applied, warns
  with the new ``power_pptx.exc.FontMetricsWarning`` when a *named* font
  family isn't installed and measurement silently falls back to Pillow's
  default metrics, and accepts ``strict=True`` to raise instead. The
  space-aware guarantee is only as good as the metrics behind it; this
  makes the degradation visible rather than silent. ``font_family`` now
  defaults to ``None`` (meaning ``"Calibri"``) so an omitted argument is
  told apart from an explicit ``"Calibri"`` — only the latter is a
  request that a fallback breaks.

Changed
.......

* ``shadow.inherit``'s deprecation warning now names ``shadow.clear()``
  and says plainly that ``inherit = False`` writes only an empty
  ``<a:effectLst/>`` and leaves an inherited theme shadow rendering. The
  property's XML behaviour is unchanged and stays symmetric — ``False``
  then ``True`` returns the shape to where it started, which delegating
  to ``clear()`` could not do, since the original ``effectRef`` index
  isn't recoverable once overwritten.


2.10.0 (2026-07-12)
+++++++++++++++++++

Maintenance release centred on a full-library OOXML-conformance
review: every emitted-XML subsystem was cross-checked against the
ISO/IEC 29500 schemas, [MS-PPTX], and Microsoft's published
references, hunting the "PowerPoint reports the file as broken /
silently repairs it" class of bug. Together with the tail of the
2.9.0 review cycle, this fixes seventeen repair triggers plus a batch
of crashes and silent-misbehaviour bugs; every fix ships with
regression tests, and the schema harness gained new structural checks
so the classes stay fixed. No new public API.

Fixed
~~~~~

- **Table border helpers crashed on a hex-string colour.**
  ``cell.borders.all(color="1F4E79")`` (and ``outer`` / ``diagonal`` /
  the ``row.borders`` / ``col.borders`` group helpers) raised
  ``TypeError`` because the colour was pre-wrapped as
  ``RGBColor(*color)``, which splat the six-character hex string into six
  positional arguments. Hex strings, ``(r, g, b)`` tuples, and
  ``RGBColor`` now all work, matching the colour convention used
  everywhere else in the library.

- **Embedding a font produced an invalid presentation.xml.**
  ``theme.embed_font(...)`` appended ``<p:embeddedFontLst>`` to the end of
  ``presentation.xml``, but the ``CT_Presentation`` sequence requires it
  *before* ``defaultTextStyle`` — an element every default template
  already carries. The out-of-order element made PowerPoint report the
  deck as broken. The list is now inserted in its schema-mandated
  position (a proper ``embeddedFontLst`` child definition on
  ``CT_Presentation`` with the correct successors).

- **Two OLE objects on one slide produced a duplicate shape id.** The
  inner "show-as-icon" ``<p:pic>`` of every embedded OLE object
  (``shapes.add_ole_object(...)``) was emitted with a hardcoded
  ``id="0"``, so a slide carrying more than one OLE object contained two
  shapes sharing that id — a non-unique shape id that makes PowerPoint
  report the deck as needing repair. Each inner pic now receives its own
  uniquely-allocated shape id.

- **3-D shapes were rejected by Microsoft PowerPoint when a bevel or
  material was turned off via the enum.** ``shape.three_d.bevel_top.preset
  = BevelPreset.NONE`` and ``shape.three_d.preset_material =
  PresetMaterial.NONE`` — the natural way to say "no bevel" / "no
  material" — emitted the token ``"none"``, which is absent from the
  ISO-29500 ``ST_BevelPresetType`` / ``ST_PresetMaterialType``
  enumerations. The file opened in python-pptx and LibreOffice but
  PowerPoint reported it as broken and offered to repair it. Assigning
  ``BevelPreset.NONE`` now removes the ``<a:bevelT>`` / ``<a:bevelB>``
  element (the schema-valid way to express "no bevel"), and
  ``PresetMaterial.NONE`` clears the ``prstMaterial`` attribute; both
  read back as ``None``. Passing Python ``None`` keeps its prior meaning
  of clearing only the preset while preserving any bevel dimensions. Use
  ``PresetMaterial.FLAT`` for an explicit flat surface.

- **Removing the last animation left schema-invalid timing XML.**
  ``entry.remove()``, ``animations.clear()``, and ``purge_orphans()``
  removed the click-group ``<p:par>`` entries but left an empty
  ``<p:childTnLst>`` behind — invalid per ``CT_TimeNodeList`` (at least
  one time-node child is required) and a PowerPoint repair trigger.
  Whichever removal takes out the last entry now prunes the whole
  ``p:timing`` subtree; a timing tree still carrying content (remaining
  effects, or a movie's ``p:video`` play-controls node) is untouched.

- **Sections stayed out of sync with the deck.** Two fixes to the
  PowerPoint-2010 section extension: an empty section
  (``prs.sections.add("Name")``) omitted its ``<p14:sldIdLst>`` child,
  which MS-PPTX 2.5.17 makes required (PowerPoint writes it even when
  empty); and ``slides.add_slide(...)`` on a sectioned deck left the new
  slide belonging to no section. New slides now join the final section,
  keeping the section list the complete partition of the deck that
  PowerPoint itself always writes.

- **Data-label ``collision_strategy`` emitted out-of-order chart XML.**
  ``"compact"`` (and a firing ``"auto"``) created ``<c:gapWidth>`` by
  bare append, landing it *after* ``<c:axId>`` — out of sequence in
  ``CT_BarChart`` and a repair trigger. The element is now inserted in
  its schema position (before ``overlap``/``serLines``/``axId``).

- **Out-of-range trendline parameters produced invalid chart XML.**
  ``trendlines.add("poly", order=10)`` / ``add("movingAvg", period=1)``
  wrote values outside the schema ranges (``ST_Order`` 2–6,
  ``ST_Period`` ≥ 2) verbatim; both now raise ``ValueError`` at the API
  boundary like the library's other range-checked chart attributes.

- **``chart.apply_dark_theme()`` / ``chart.text_color`` crashed on
  scatter charts.** ``CT_ScatterChart`` lacked the ``dLbls`` accessor its
  sibling plot classes define, so the data-label sweep raised
  ``AttributeError`` (``plot.has_data_labels`` on a scatter plot crashed
  on both read and write). The accessor is now defined in its correct
  ``CT_ScatterChart`` sequence position.

- **A hidden secondary value axis multiplied on re-access.**
  ``axis.visible = False`` writes a bare ``<c:delete/>`` (the ``val``
  attribute is dropped as the schema default), which made the
  secondary-axis detection stop matching — each later
  ``chart.secondary_value_axis`` access piled a fresh axis pair onto the
  plot area. Detection no longer filters on delete-state.

- **Palettes skipped radar-chart strokes.** ``apply_palette`` /
  ``recolour`` on ``RADAR`` / ``RADAR_MARKERS`` charts wrote only the
  (invisible) shape fill; radar series now get their line stroke
  painted like the other line-rendered chart types.

- **``fill.gradient_angle`` crashed on the library's own default
  gradient.** The default ``<a:lin scaled="0"/>`` (and a
  radial→linear ``change_to_kind`` switch) carries no ``ang``
  attribute, and the read raised ``TypeError`` on ``360.0 - None``. An
  ``a:lin`` without ``ang`` now reads as the effective angle ``0.0``.

- **``shape.three_d`` raised a bare ``AttributeError`` on groups and
  graphic frames.** Both now raise an explanatory
  ``NotImplementedError`` instead, mirroring the sibling effect facades
  (a group's ``grpSpPr`` legally carries ``scene3d`` but not ``sp3d``,
  so the facade cannot target it without emitting invalid XML).

- **Cross-deck ``import_slide`` / ``apply_template`` produced structurally
  broken packages in several master-cloning paths.** Fixed as a group:

  * A cloned slide master kept the *source's* ``p:sldLayoutIdLst`` rIds
    while its new relationships put the theme on ``rId1`` — the first
    "layout" entry resolved to the theme part, the rest were off by
    one, and the last layout was unlisted. The id list is now rebuilt
    entry-by-entry as layouts are cloned, with fresh unique ids
    allocated across the whole presentation (duplicate
    ``sldMasterId``/``sldLayoutId`` ids are themselves a repair
    trigger).
  * Cloned masters and layouts lost their own image dependencies
    (template logos, backgrounds), leaving dangling ``r:embed``
    references. Their dependency graphs are now copied and remapped
    like the slide's.
  * A layout cloned into an existing (deduped) master was related but
    never registered in the master's ``p:sldLayoutIdLst``, leaving it
    invisible to PowerPoint's layout picker.
  * A copied notes slide's back-reference to its slide cloned the
    entire slide graph a second time — an orphan slide part the notes
    slide pointed at instead of the registered slide.
  * The copied notes slide dropped its ``notesSlide→notesMaster``
    relationship entirely (and the destination got no notes master);
    it is now re-linked to the destination's own notes master, created
    from the default template when absent.
  * The next-slide-partname allocator counted ``p:sldIdLst`` entries
    only, so ``add_slide()`` after an import could write a second,
    different part under an existing partname — a duplicate zip member
    name, which OPC forbids. It now scans the package's actual
    partnames.

- **Latent oxml attribute types corrected against the XSD.**
  ``a:reflection@kx/@ky`` are now ``ST_FixedAngle`` (exclusive ±90°,
  no silent modulo-360 normalization), ``a:outerShdw@dir`` is
  ``ST_PositiveFixedAngle`` (matching ``a:innerShdw``), and
  ``a:lum@bright/@contrast`` are ``ST_FixedPercentage`` (±100%). Also,
  resetting picture ``brightness``/``contrast`` to ``0.0`` no longer
  strands a dead empty ``<a:lum/>`` on the blip.

- **Morph transitions were emitted in the wrong namespace.** MS-PPTX
  defines ``morph`` in the PowerPoint-2016 namespace
  (``…/powerpoint/2015/09/main``, prefix ``p159``), not the 2010
  ``p14`` namespace this library used — and because every modern
  PowerPoint understands ``p14``, MCE selected that branch and hit an
  undefined element: the repair dialog, on the headline Morph feature.
  Morph now serializes as ``<p159:morph>`` inside an ``mc:Choice
  Requires="p159"``; round-tripping a PowerPoint-authored morph deck
  no longer writes the p159 kind bare into ``p:sld`` (a hard
  ``CT_SlideTransition`` violation) or into the ISO-pure fallback;
  extension-kind fallbacks carry ``<p:fade/>`` (PowerPoint's own
  downgrade) instead of rendering as a cut; and legacy decks written
  with ``p14:morph`` are healed on re-save.

- **Motion paths could contain exponent-notation coordinates.**
  ``%g`` formatting wrote ``1.5e-17``-style float noise into
  ``animMotion`` paths (``MotionPath.spiral`` on essentially every
  call); the path grammar has no exponent form, so PowerPoint dropped
  the animation. Coordinates are now fixed-point with noise clamped
  to ``0``.

- **Section list integrity, round two.** ``Sections.remove()`` /
  ``Section.delete()`` now merge the removed section's slides into the
  neighbouring section (PowerPoint's own "Remove Section" behaviour)
  instead of orphaning them, and removing the only section drops the
  whole extension block rather than leaving an empty
  ``<p14:sectionLst/>`` (itself invalid — ``minOccurs=1``).
  ``Section.add_slide()`` moves a slide between sections instead of
  letting two sections reference it. A first section created with
  ``start_slide_index > 0`` now gets an auto-created "Default Section"
  covering the preceding slides. ``import_slide`` onto a sectioned
  deck adds the imported slide to the final section. Section ids are
  validated as unique brace-wrapped GUIDs. And reading
  ``prs.sections`` no longer injects the PowerPoint-2010 extension
  block into a section-less deck.

- **Embedded fonts survived exactly one save.** ``embed_font`` never
  set ``embedTrueTypeFonts="1"`` on ``p:presentation``, so PowerPoint
  considered embedding disabled and silently stripped the ``fntdata``
  parts and font list the next time a user saved the deck in
  PowerPoint. Also hardened the ``ThemeFonts`` recovery path for
  themes missing a required font collection (it previously emitted a
  ``latin``-only collection appended out of order — itself
  repair-trigger XML).

- **~30 of the built-in table-style GUIDs were wrong.** Entries in
  ``TABLE_STYLES`` were fabricated or mapped to a different style than
  their name claimed — ``"Dark Style 1"`` selected *No Style, No
  Grid*, ``"Medium Style 2"`` selected *No Style, Table Grid*, the
  Medium 3 / Dark 1 / Dark 2 / Light 3 accent rows were shuffled or
  invented, and ``name_for_guid`` mislabelled genuine PowerPoint
  decks. A GUID outside the built-in set is schema-valid but
  PowerPoint silently applies **no styling at all**. Every entry is
  now verbatim from Microsoft's published list (hh273476); the
  fabricated ``"Themed Style N - No Color"`` aliases are removed.

The ``tests/schema`` harness that guards this class of bug also grew
five PowerPoint-specific structural checks the XSDs cannot express —
duplicate shape ids within a slide, dangling relationship references
(``r:id`` / ``r:embed`` / ``r:link`` targets with no matching
relationship, and relationships pointing at missing parts), package
parts absent from ``[Content_Types].xml``, duplicate zip member names
(two payloads under one OPC part name), and slide parts absent from
``p:sldIdLst`` (orphans left by a botched copy) — each a real
"PowerPoint repairs the file" trigger, each with a self-test proving
it detects its target.


2.9.0 (2026-06-25)
++++++++++++++++++

Minor release widening the public surface across many subsystems: the
**group-shape API** (fill, move, recursive traversal, shrink-wrap, and a
real ``ungroup()``), **run-level text effects and typography**, **shape
inner/preset shadows**, **chart plot/axis toggles plus series
trendlines, error bars, and a secondary value axis**, **table cell text
direction and the built-in table-style gallery**, **international &
multi-column text layout**, **theme dark-mode and palette-from-seed**,
a **Sections API**, **slide reorder/move and first-class notes**,
**accessibility (alt text + audit)**, and **machine-readable lint/audit
output with SARIF export and baseline diff**, plus a couple of
fail-closed ``from_spec`` ergonomics fixes. All additions are drop-in
compatible.

Added
~~~~~

- ``group.fill`` — a |FillFormat| on the group's ``p:grpSpPr``, so a
  whole group can be tinted in one call (``group.fill.solid();
  group.fill.fore_color.rgb = "1F4E79"``). Member shapes that declare
  their own fill paint on top, unaffected. Note the OOXML schema admits
  a fill but *not* a line (``a:ln``) on a group, so there is
  deliberately no ``group.line`` — emitting one would produce a file
  PowerPoint reports as broken.

- ``group.move(dx, dy)`` — translate an entire group (and every shape
  it contains) by an offset in one O(1) operation, instead of walking
  and nudging each child.

- ``group.walk()`` — generate every descendant shape depth-first,
  recursing into nested groups, so whole-tree layout, measurement, and
  lint passes no longer need hand-rolled recursion.

- ``group.fit_to_children()`` — shrink-wrap the group's offset/extent to
  tightly bound its members (the same recalculation that runs when a
  shape is added through ``group.shapes.add_*``), keeping ``group.bbox``
  accurate after member shapes are edited directly.

- ``group.ungroup()`` — dissolve a group, promoting its members to the
  parent shape tree with their position and size transformed out of the
  group's child coordinate space so nothing moves or resizes visually.
  Z-order is preserved and the promoted shapes are returned. Raises
  ``ValueError`` for a rotated or flipped group, where baking the
  transform into each child is ambiguous.

- **``add_table`` / ``add_movie`` on group shape-trees.** Both lived
  only on the slide shape-tree even though ``p:graphicFrame`` /
  ``p:pic`` are schema-valid inside a ``p:grpSp``. They now sit on the
  shared base, so ``group.shapes.add_table(...)`` /
  ``group.shapes.add_movie(...)`` work — a table or video can be bundled
  into a group with a caption or badge, and the group's extent
  shrink-wraps to include it. Video play-controls timing is still
  registered on the enclosing slide. Slide-level usage is unchanged.

- **Machine-readable lint / audit output.** ``SlideLintReport.to_dict()``
  / ``.to_json()`` and ``AuditReport.to_dict()`` / ``.to_json()`` return
  a self-describing payload — each issue carries its ``code``,
  ``severity``, ``message``, the names of the shapes involved, and every
  detector-specific field (``TextOverflow.ratio``, ``OffSlide.side``,
  the ``ShapeCollision`` scoring, …) picked up automatically from the
  issue dataclass. This is the counterpart to the existing human-readable
  ``summary()`` / ``markdown()`` and is built for the agent loop that
  generates a deck, audits it, and feeds the result back to a model (or a
  CI gate) to decide what to fix, e.g. ``if audit(prs).to_dict()
  ["has_errors"]: ...``.

- **Run-property typography on ``Font``.** New tri-state properties on
  ``run.font`` / ``paragraph.font`` close the ``<a:rPr>`` gap that
  separates "looks branded" from "looks generated":
  ``all_caps`` / ``small_caps`` (the ``cap`` attribute — mutually
  exclusive), ``letter_spacing`` (tracking, a ``Length`` via the ``spc``
  attribute, negative tightens), ``strikethrough`` (``strike``), and
  ``superscript`` / ``subscript`` (the shared ``baseline`` shift). Each
  reads back ``None`` when inherited and round-trips / schema-validates.
  Backed by new ``ST_TextPoint`` / ``ST_TextCapsType`` /
  ``ST_TextStrikeType`` simple types wired onto
  ``CT_TextCharacterProperties``.

- **"Did you mean …?" for typo'd spec keys.** ``from_spec`` /
  ``from_yaml`` already fail closed on unknown keys; the error now names
  the closest valid candidate (via ``difflib``) for unknown top-level
  keys, unknown recipe kwargs, unknown ``transition`` names, and unknown
  ``slide_size`` shorthands — e.g. ``Unknown spec keys: 'slidez' (did
  you mean 'slides'?)``. Makes a spec typo recoverable in a single
  follow-up, which matters most for an LLM authoring the spec.

- **Run-level text effects on ``Font``.** ``run.font.outline`` returns a
  |LineFormat| over the run's text-outline stroke (``<a:ln>`` of
  ``<a:rPr>``), giving glyphs a coloured outline of a chosen width.
  ``run.font.shadow`` / ``run.font.glow`` return |ShadowFormat| /
  |GlowFormat| over the run's ``<a:effectLst>``. All three read
  non-mutatingly (no XML until assigned), preserving theme inheritance.

- **Inner- and preset-shadow effects on shapes.** ``shape.inner_shadow``
  (``InnerShadowFormat`` over ``<a:innerShdw>``) and
  ``shape.preset_shadow`` (``PresetShadowFormat`` over ``<a:prstShdw>``)
  join ``shape.shadow`` as first-class effect proxies. ``inner_shadow``
  exposes ``blur_radius`` / ``distance`` / ``direction`` / ``color``;
  ``preset_shadow`` exposes ``preset`` (an ``MSO_PRESET_SHADOW`` member
  or ``"shdw1".."shdw20"`` string) plus geometry and colour. New
  ``MSO_PRESET_SHADOW`` enum. The required ``prst`` and a colour child
  are always emitted, so output stays schema-valid.

- **Chart "go to Excel for this" toggles.** ``DoughnutPlot.hole_size``
  (int 10–90), ``LinePlot.smooth`` (bool, smooths every series), and
  ``ValueAxis.log_base`` (float 2–1000, or ``None`` for a linear axis).
  ``smooth`` is exposed only where the series element permits it, so it
  doesn't re-introduce the radar-chart ``<c:smooth>`` schema bug.

- **Table cell text direction.** ``cell.text_direction`` rotates or
  stacks cell text via friendly strings (``"horizontal"``,
  ``"rotate90"``, ``"rotate270"``, ``"stacked"``) over the
  ``<a:tcPr vert="…">`` attribute — what matrix / rotated column
  headers need — paired with the existing ``cell.vertical_anchor``
  alias.

- **Chart series analytics.** ``series.trendlines.add(kind, …)`` adds
  ``<c:trendline>`` curves (linear, exponential, logarithmic,
  moving-average, polynomial, power) with optional equation / R²
  display, polynomial order, moving-average period, and forward/backward
  projection. ``series.error_bars`` offers Excel-style constructors
  ``fixed()`` / ``percentage()`` / ``standard_deviation()`` /
  ``standard_error()`` / ``custom(plus, minus)``. ``chart.secondary_value_axis``
  (and ``series.axis_group = "secondary"``) adds a second value axis and
  moves a plot onto it — new axis ids stay in the signed-int32 range so
  PowerPoint never flags the file for repair. Analytics are exposed only
  on series types whose schema permits them (bar/line/scatter/area/bubble,
  not pie/radar).

- **Table-style gallery.** ``table.style`` applies one of PowerPoint's
  built-in table styles by friendly name (``"Medium Style 2 - Accent 1"``,
  ``"Table Grid"``, ``"No Style, No Grid"``, …) or by raw ``{GUID}``.
  Reading returns the friendly name for known built-ins, else the GUID,
  else |None|; ``table.style = None`` detaches the style. The discoverable
  name→GUID mapping is exposed as ``power_pptx.table_styles.TABLE_STYLES``;
  unknown names raise ``ValueError`` with a "did you mean" hint.

- **International & layout text properties.** ``paragraph.rtl`` sets
  right-to-left direction (Hebrew / Arabic / Farsi). ``paragraph.start_at``
  / ``paragraph.set_numbered(scheme, start_at)`` start a numbered list at
  an arbitrary value. ``text_frame.column_count`` / ``text_frame.column_spacing``
  lay text out in multiple columns. ``paragraph.tab_stops`` is a collection
  over ``<a:tabLst>`` with ``add_tab_stop(position, alignment)``.

- **Theme dark-mode & palette-from-seed.** ``prs.theme.to_dark_mode()``
  produces a dark variant of a deck's theme in place — swapping the
  background/text pairs and lightening accents only as needed to keep WCAG
  AA contrast. ``DesignTokens.from_seed(seed, harmony=…)`` generates a
  full, deterministic palette from one seed colour (complementary /
  analogous / triadic / monochromatic), and
  ``DesignTokens.validate_color_blindness(…)`` flags palette pairs
  confusable under deuteranopia / protanopia / tritanopia.

- **Sections API.** ``prs.sections`` exposes the named slide groupings
  shown in PowerPoint's outline / slide-sorter pane (stored as the
  PowerPoint-2010 ``p14:sectionLst`` presentation extension). The
  ``Sections`` collection supports ``len`` / indexing / iteration,
  ``.add(name, start_slide_index=None)`` and ``.remove(section)``; each
  ``Section`` exposes ``.name`` (read/write), ``.id`` (GUID),
  ``.slides`` / ``.slide_ids``, and ``.delete()``.

- **Slide reorder/move and first-class notes.** ``prs.slides.move(old,
  new)`` relocates a single slide and ``prs.slides.reorder(order)``
  applies a full permutation (indices or ``Slide`` objects) without raw
  ``sldIdLst`` surgery. ``slide.notes`` is a read/write speaker-notes
  accessor — reading returns ``""`` without creating a notes slide,
  assigning a string writes the notes text frame (creating it on
  demand). The LLM-friendly "deck + notes" path.

- **Accessibility.** ``shape.alt_text`` maps to the ``descr`` attribute
  of the shape's ``<p:cNvPr>`` (the alt-text slot screen readers
  announce) and ``shape.title_text`` to the companion ``title``.
  ``power_pptx.accessibility.audit_accessibility(prs)`` returns a
  read-only report flagging pictures/meaningful shapes missing alt text,
  text below WCAG AA contrast, and slides without a title — with
  ``has_errors`` / ``markdown()`` / ``to_dict()`` / ``to_json()``.

- **Lint CI extensions.** ``SlideLintReport.to_sarif()`` /
  ``to_sarif_json()`` emit a SARIF v2.1.0 document (the GitHub
  code-scanning interchange format) with a ``power-pptx-lint`` driver
  and per-issue results (severity mapped error/warning/note);
  ``lint_report_to_sarif(reports)`` aggregates a whole deck with slide
  indices. ``SlideLintReport.diff(baseline)`` returns only
  newly-introduced issues (matched by stable fingerprints, so a
  moved-but-still-broken shape isn't flagged), and ``diff_detail()``
  adds the fixed set.

Fixed
~~~~~

- **``from_spec`` no longer silently swallows an unknown layout name.**
  A typo'd / unrecognized ``"layout"`` used to fall back to the Blank
  layout silently, so a misspelled ``"titel"`` produced a blank slide
  that looked like the styled layout simply hadn't applied. It now
  raises ``ValueError`` with the closest valid layout suggested — the
  same fail-closed-on-typos contract already used for unknown spec
  keys. Pass ``"layout": "blank"`` explicitly for a deliberately blank
  slide.

These additions ship with unit tests, a round-trip test, and
ISO-29500 schema-validity tests for the new group-fill and run-property
XML.


2.8.1 (2026-06-17)
++++++++++++++++++

Patch release fixing four ISO/IEC 29500 schema-validity bugs surfaced
by an aggressive deck-generation stress suite (``examples/stress_test/``).
Each bug produced a file that opens in python-pptx and LibreOffice but
that Microsoft PowerPoint reports as broken / silently repairs — the
exact class the ``schema-validation`` CI gate exists to catch.  Every
fix ships with a reproducing deck builder in
``tests/schema/test_schema_validity.py``.

Fixed
~~~~~

- **Charts were rejected by Microsoft PowerPoint (every chart type).**
  The chart axis ids (``c:axId`` / ``c:crossAx``) hardcoded in the chart XML
  writer used values above ``2**31`` (e.g. ``2226939960``). ISO-29500 types
  these as ``xsd:unsignedInt`` so they pass schema validation, python-pptx and
  LibreOffice both open them — but PowerPoint parses ``axId`` as a *signed*
  32-bit integer, so any value over ``2**31-1`` overflows to a negative number
  and PowerPoint reports the deck as needing repair. All axis ids are now in
  the valid signed-int32 range (``1 .. 2**31-1``). The ``schema-validation``
  harness gained an explicit axis-id range check (the XSD cannot express it),
  with a self-test that confirms it fires.

- **Slide-transition duration emitted an invalid bare ``p14:dur``.**
  Setting ``slide.transition.duration`` wrote the PowerPoint-2010
  extension attribute ``p14:dur`` directly on a plain
  ``<p:transition>``.  That attribute is only schema-valid inside the
  ``<mc:AlternateContent><mc:Choice Requires="p14">`` wrapper, which
  was previously created only for p14 *kind* elements (Morph, …).  A
  classic transition (Fade, Push, …) carrying a duration therefore
  produced an invalid file.  The wrapper is now applied whenever the
  transition holds any p14 content — kind *or* attribute — and a
  classic kind is preserved in the ``<mc:Fallback>`` for pre-2010
  viewers.

- **Radar charts emitted a disallowed ``<c:smooth>`` element.**
  ``CT_RadarSer`` does not admit ``smooth`` (it is a line/scatter
  series element); it is no longer written for ``RADAR`` /
  ``RADAR_MARKERS`` / ``RADAR_FILLED`` charts.

- **``PresetMaterial.SOFT_METAL`` emitted ``softMetal``.**  The
  ISO ``ST_PresetMaterialType`` enumeration spells this value
  all-lowercase (``softmetal``); the XML value is corrected so 3-D
  shapes using the soft-metal material validate.

- **Picture recolor ``"washout"`` dropped the required ``thresh``
  attribute.**  ``<a:biLevel>``'s ``thresh`` was declared as an
  ``OptionalAttribute`` with ``default=0.5``, so assigning the common
  value ``0.5`` made the serializer omit the (schema-required)
  attribute.  ``thresh`` is now a ``RequiredAttribute`` and is always
  written.

Added
~~~~~

- ``examples/stress_test/`` — a bug-surfacing deck suite plus a harness
  that checks every generated deck through build, lint, round-trip,
  reopen, and ISO-29500 schema validation.


2.8.0 (2026-05-22)
++++++++++++++++++

Minor release adding a high-level geometry / text / arrow / diagram
surface that collapses the seven-line styling rituals LLM-generated
deck code repeatedly reinvents.  Motivated by the v2.7-era
recommendations captured during a real AI Engineering deck rebuild
— the friction points where the existing 1.0.2 surface forced
generated code to re-implement the same glue every time.

All additions are drop-in compatible.  The 1.0.2 + post-fork
surface continues to work unchanged.

Added
~~~~~

- ``power_pptx.BBox`` — immutable rectangular-region value object
  with EMU storage.  Constructors: ``from_inches``, ``from_emu``,
  ``from_shape``, ``from_slide``.  Transforms: ``inset(all=, x=, y=,
  left=, top=, right=, bottom=)``, ``shifted``, ``resized``, ``sub``.
  Splits: ``split_h([1, 1], gap=)``, ``split_v``, ``grid(cols, rows,
  gap_x=, gap_y=)``.  Predicates: ``contains``, ``intersects``,
  ``intersection``, ``union``.  Unpacks to ``(left, top, width,
  height)`` so it splats into every ``add_*`` API
  (``slide.shapes.add_shape(MSO_SHAPE.RECT, *bbox)``).  Re-exported
  from the package root.  Available as ``shape.bbox`` for any shape.

- ``slide.shapes.add_text(bbox_or_lengths, text=..., font=...,
  size_pt=..., bold=..., italic=..., color=..., align="center",
  anchor="middle", margin_pt=..., word_wrap=True)`` — one-call
  styled textbox.  Hex strings, ``RGBColor``, and ``(r, g, b)``
  tuples all accepted for colours; short-name strings
  (``"left"``/``"center"``/``"right"``/``"justify"`` and
  ``"top"``/``"middle"``/``"bottom"``) accepted for alignment and
  anchor — no enum imports required.  Returns the textbox shape.

- ``slide.shapes.add_arrow(start, end, head="triangle", tail=None,
  color=..., weight_pt=1.5, style="solid", route="straight",
  inset_pt=6.0, start_side="auto", end_side="auto")`` — connector
  with a real arrowhead, auto-routed mid-edge endpoints, and a
  configurable inset so the head doesn't bleed into the target
  shape.  Endpoints accept ``BaseShape``, ``BBox``, or ``(x, y)``.

- ``shape.fill_hex("#0B5CFF")`` and ``shape.line_hex("#0D0D0D",
  weight_pt=1.25)`` — chainable hex-string shortcuts that return
  ``self``.  Accept ``None`` to clear, hex strings with or without
  the leading ``#``, ``RGBColor`` instances, and ``(r, g, b)``
  tuples.

- ``shape.set_text_preserving_format(new_text)`` — captures the
  first paragraph's ``<a:pPr>`` and the first run's ``<a:rPr>``,
  rebuilds the text body for ``new_text`` (one paragraph per
  ``"\n"``), then re-applies those properties to every new run.
  Font face / size / colour / bold / italic on the template run
  are preserved verbatim.

- ``Picture.replace_with(builder, padding=0)`` — deletes the
  picture and calls ``builder(slide, bbox)`` in its place, with
  ``bbox`` shrunk by ``padding``.  ``Picture.enclosing_container(
  exclude_text=True, shrink_around=True)`` walks the slide to find
  the smallest non-text-bearing shape enclosing the picture (the
  "card" the picture lives inside) and trims that bbox to avoid
  sibling content.

- ``slide.slide_bbox()`` returns the full slide ``BBox``.
  ``slide.content_bbox(include_decorative=False)`` returns the
  union of non-background shapes.  ``slide.find_empty_region(
  near=, min_width=, min_height=)`` returns a free region on the
  slide.  ``slide.tidy(fix_offslide=True, fix_overflow=True,
  fix_grid_drift=False)`` is the one-call lint + safe auto-fix.

- ``power_pptx.diagrams`` module — six native-shape diagram
  recipes covering ~80% of architecture-deck patterns:
  ``horizontal_pipeline``, ``vertical_pipeline``, ``hub_and_spoke``,
  ``cycle``, ``decision_tree``, ``comparison_columns``.  Each takes
  a slide, a ``BBox``, and a small content spec; returns a small
  result dataclass exposing the constituent shapes.  Recipes tag
  their shapes with a shared ``lint_group`` so intentional
  arrow-into-card overlaps don't flood ``slide.lint()`` /
  ``audit()`` output.

- ``power_pptx.audit(prs, size_warn_bytes=2_000_000,
  check_fonts=True)`` — whole-deck audit returning an
  ``AuditReport`` with ``lint_issues`` (each tagged with the slide
  index it came from), ``broken_pictures``, ``empty_slides``,
  ``font_warnings`` (fonts outside a conservative
  Windows/macOS/Office safe-list), and ``size_warnings``
  (pictures larger than ``size_warn_bytes``).  ``report.markdown()``
  renders a chat-reply-ready summary.  Read-only — never mutates
  the deck.

- ``power_pptx.render.render_slides(prs, *, out_dir=,
  slides=[0, 1, 2], name_template="slide-{:02d}.png", scale=0.5)``
  — friendlier wrapper around ``render_slide_thumbnails`` with
  cleaner argument names and a string-format template for output
  filenames.  ``scale=`` is translated to ``dpi=`` internally.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New cheat-sheet block at the top of ``SKILL.md`` covering the
  25 most-common deck-generation operations on one screen.
- New anti-patterns block flagging the LLM-common mistakes:
  comparing ``tf.paragraphs`` wrappers with ``is``, assuming
  ``add_connector`` produces an arrowhead, sizing a rebuild to a
  picture bbox when there's an enclosing card, etc.
- New ``references/geometry-and-arrows.md`` covering the full new
  API surface with worked examples.
- README rewritten to lead with space-aware authoring, document
  ``python -m power_pptx.skill install``, list the post-fork
  feature set, and provide an end-to-end quick-start example.

Review-driven hardening (during PR #34)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``BBox.split_h`` / ``split_v`` / ``grid`` now distribute the span
  with a running-remainder apportionment, so the emitted segments
  sum to exactly the input span — previously each segment's width
  was rounded independently and could drift by ±1 EMU per split,
  which then accumulated across nested grids.
- ``BBox.intersects()`` docstring corrected to match the
  implementation: touching edges do *not* count as intersection
  (matching the standard "shared area" interpretation).
- ``slide.shapes.add_arrow(head=, tail=, head_size=, tail_size=)``
  now validates every choice up front and raises ``ValueError`` on
  typos, with case-insensitive matching for the four enum-like
  string arguments.  Previously an unknown name silently produced
  a headless connector.
- ``slide.find_empty_region(near=...)`` validates the ``near``
  argument and raises ``TypeError`` for unexpected types
  (previously raised ``AttributeError`` deep inside).
- ``render_slides(name_template=)`` now validates the template
  format string *before* rendering — a template without a
  positional placeholder (which would silently overwrite every
  PNG with the same filename) raises ``ValueError``.
- ``Picture.enclosing_container(shrink_around=True)`` rebuilt to
  pick the smallest valid edge-trim that excludes each obstacle
  while still containing the picture.  The old heuristic could
  collapse onto the obstacle (e.g. a title strip above the picture
  caused the bottom edge to be pushed up, returning the top strip
  instead of the picture area).
- ``audit()``'s ``empty_slides`` check now also skips slide-spanning
  background rectangles (any shape ≥95% of the slide area without
  live text), matching the documented contract.
- ``shape.fill_hex`` / ``shape.line_hex`` type annotations
  corrected to ``str | None`` (both already supported ``None`` to
  clear).
- ``hub_and_spoke`` recipe no longer creates a rectangle then
  deletes it to add an oval — it builds the oval directly.

Tests
~~~~~

- 68 new unit tests across ``tests/test_geometry.py``,
  ``tests/test_shape_helpers.py``, ``tests/test_diagrams.py``,
  ``tests/test_audit.py``, and ``tests/test_render_slides_alias.py``
  cover the new API surface, the validation paths, and the
  regression cases from the review feedback.  Full 3582-test suite
  passes.


2.7.0 (2026-05-17)
++++++++++++++++++

Minor release rolling up the playground-driven improvement batch
(``examples/playground/IMPROVEMENTS.md``).  These are the fixes a
real authoring session — building five varied decks against the
recipe + ``from_spec`` paths — surfaced as friction points or
silent footguns.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``Chart.apply_palette`` now also sets ``series.format.line.color.rgb``
  on the line-stroke chart family — ``LINE``, ``LINE_MARKERS``,
  ``LINE_STACKED``, ``LINE_STACKED_100``, ``LINE_MARKERS_STACKED``,
  ``LINE_MARKERS_STACKED_100``, ``THREE_D_LINE``,
  ``XY_SCATTER_LINES`` (+ smooth and no-marker variants).  Previously
  only the per-series fill was written, so the call appeared to do
  nothing on a line chart — the renderer fell back to the default
  Office palette because the visible colour is the stroke, not the
  fill.  ``Chart.recolour`` got the same fix.

- ``XL_CHART_TYPE.XY_SCATTER`` now emits ``<c:scatterStyle val="marker"/>``
  instead of ``val="lineMarker"`` + per-series ``<a:ln><a:noFill/>``.
  The legacy combination still reads back as ``XY_SCATTER`` so older
  decks round-trip, but newly-saved scatters are robust against
  callers that recolour a series via ``series.format.line.color.rgb``
  (which previously overwrote the ``noFill`` suppression and silently
  flipped the chart to "lines with markers").

- ``TextFrame.fit_text`` measurement now uses
  ``max(ink_box_height, point_size * 1.2)`` as the per-line vertical
  cost, so a 72pt title in a 2-inch box no longer claims to fit when
  wrapping forces a second line.  Pillow's getbbox returns the *ink
  box* — descenders and ascender included but not line leading — so
  the old predicate under-counted wrapped-line height by ~40% and
  picked a font size that overflowed.

- ``TextFrame.fit_text`` now raises ``ValueError`` when even 1pt
  overflows the frame, with an actionable message.  Pre-fix the
  method silently returned ``None`` and the downstream ``Pt(None)``
  setter crashed with a confusing ``TypeError``.

- ``slide.lint()`` ``TextOverflow`` heuristic now uses ``math.ceil``
  on wrapped-line counts.  A 31-char line wrapping to two real lines
  used to count as 1.5 lines in the heuristic — under the
  ``lines_available`` threshold — and the overflow was missed even
  though every renderer drew the second line below the frame.

Added
~~~~~

- ``Table.clear_style()`` detaches the default
  "Medium Style 2 — Accent 1" table-style ID attached to every
  ``slide.shapes.add_table(...)``.  Necessary because the built-in
  style applies its own banded-row overlay that survives
  ``table.horz_banding = False`` and ``table.first_row = False``;
  callers who paint every cell themselves can now stop the bleed
  in one line.

- ``from_spec`` accepts a ``slide_size`` field — named shorthand
  (``"16:9"``, ``"widescreen"``, ``"4:3"``, ``"standard"``,
  ``"16:10"``, ``"a4"``, ``"letter"``), a ``(width, height)`` pair
  in inches, or a ``{"width": …, "height": …}`` mapping.  Previously
  every spec-driven deck rendered at the bundled template's 4:3
  default regardless of which recipes it called.

- ``from_spec`` accepts a pre-built
  :class:`~power_pptx.design.tokens.DesignTokens` instance under the
  ``tokens`` key.  Previously the resolver rejected anything that
  wasn't a ``Mapping`` with "must be a mapping"; sharing tokens
  between imperative recipe calls and ``from_spec`` had to
  round-trip through a (non-existent) ``.to_dict()``.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- ``from_spec`` ``"theme"`` key — listed in ``_VALID_TOP_KEYS`` for
  years — is now wired up as a friendly alias for ``"tokens"`` when
  the latter is absent.  Previously the validator accepted it and
  ``_resolve_tokens`` silently ignored it, producing an unstyled deck
  from any spec that used the documented ``theme`` shape.  ``tokens``
  wins when both are present.

- ``from_spec`` legacy layout aliases ``"title"`` and ``"bullets"``
  are now auto-upgraded to their recipe counterparts
  (``"title_recipe"`` / ``"bullets_recipe"``) when ``tokens`` is
  supplied.  Previously the legacy placeholder path was taken and
  the user's palette / typography was silently ignored.  Specs that
  pass no ``tokens`` continue to hit the placeholder layouts
  unchanged.

- Recipe titles (``title_slide``, ``bullet_slide``, ``kpi_slide``,
  ``quote_slide``, ``image_hero_slide``, ``chart_slide``,
  ``table_slide``, ``code_slide``, ``timeline_slide``,
  ``comparison_slide``, ``figure_slide``) now set
  ``auto_size = TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` on the title text frame.  Long
  titles that wrapped to a second line no longer spill below the
  fixed-height title region into the body content underneath.  KPI
  card label / value / delta boxes got the same treatment so long
  labels like "Lines of code per slide" stop pushing the delta on
  top of the label.

Docs
~~~~

- ``references/design.md`` calls out that ``tokens.palette[k]``
  returns ``RGBColor`` (not a hex string); every public setter
  accepts the rich form, so ``RGBColor.from_hex(tokens.palette[k])``
  is unnecessary (and crashes).

- ``references/render.md`` documents three cross-renderer footguns
  worth knowing about when reviewing via
  ``Presentation.render_thumbnails`` — emoji tofu without an emoji
  font installed, LibreOffice centering un-aligned text that
  PowerPoint left-aligns, and ``wrap="none" + spAutoFit`` re-centering
  un-wrapped textboxes inside their original width.

- ``references/tables.md`` documents ``Table.clear_style()`` and the
  default-style-banding gotcha that motivates it.

- ``references/compose.md`` documents ``slide_size``, the
  ``theme``-as-``tokens``-alias behaviour, the legacy-layout
  auto-upgrade, and the ``DesignTokens`` instance acceptance.


2.6.1 (2026-05-08)
++++++++++++++++++

Patch release closing two more entries in the Issue-0 family — the
PowerPoint-strict-validation bug class first surfaced by the v2.6.0
doughnut ``<a:endParaRPr/>`` fix.  Both bugs pass python-pptx's
integrity check and round-trip through LibreOffice cleanly, but
Microsoft PowerPoint's open-time validator rejects them with the
"PowerPoint found a problem with content. Repair?" dialog and
silently drops the offending content on accept.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Chart text-property blocks (``<c:txPr>``) and rich-title text
  (``<c:rich>``) constructed lazily by font / colour customisation no
  longer emit ``<a:p>`` paragraphs without ``<a:endParaRPr>``.  The
  missing terminator triggered the "Repair?" dialog whenever a chart
  data label or legend font was customised after data labels were
  enabled (the most common pattern: ``chart.text_color = ...`` after
  ``has_data_labels = True``).  The same fix applies to the dLbl
  template, the chart-title rich-text builder, and the autoshape
  text-body templates.

- Float-valued coordinates passed to shape constructors are now
  coerced to integer EMU at the API boundary.  Users routinely write
  arithmetic like ``card_w = (Inches(N) - gutter) / 2`` (Python's
  ``/`` produces a float) and pass the result to ``add_chart``,
  ``add_shape``, ``add_textbox``, ``add_picture``, ``add_table``,
  ``add_connector``, ``add_movie``, ``add_ole_object``, or
  ``add_svg_picture``.  Pre-fix, the float landed verbatim in the
  saved XML's ``<a:off>`` / ``<a:ext>`` attributes — schema-invalid
  per ``CT_Point2D`` (``xs:long``) and ``CT_PositiveSize2D``
  (``xs:nonNegativeInteger``), and rejected by PowerPoint with
  "Repair?".  ``shape.left`` / ``shape.top`` / ``shape.width`` /
  ``shape.height`` setters apply the same coercion.

Added
~~~~~

- PowerPoint-strict regression tests in
  ``tests/test_powerpoint_strict_validation.py`` now scan saved decks
  for the three known PowerPoint-rejection patterns (``<a:p>`` with
  no terminator and no text run, ``<a:endParaRPr>`` missing
  ``lang``, and float-valued ``<a:off>`` / ``<a:ext>`` coordinates).
  Each historical Issue-0-family bug has a pinned regression
  fixture; the rule list grows as new strict-validator patterns are
  discovered in the field.


2.6.0 (2026-05-07)
++++++++++++++++++

Follows up the v2.5 review with the P0 bug fix, the P1 ergonomic
additions identified in the user feedback document, and the
previously-deferred P2/P3 items (lint group context manager,
formats helpers, data-label collision strategy, the remaining
shape-level building blocks, a constrained shape.animate() façade,
and a deck-level PowerPoint-strict test scan).

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``area`` and ``doughnut`` chart writers no longer emit a bare
  ``<a:endParaRPr/>``.  The bare form is schema-valid but Microsoft
  PowerPoint's open-time validator is stricter than the spec and
  prompted users to "Repair" any deck containing one of these chart
  types, deleting the chart contents on accept.  All writers now
  emit ``<a:endParaRPr lang="en-US"/>`` and a regression test asserts
  the property holds for every chart writer.

New APIs
~~~~~~~~

- ``Chart.recolour(palette, by="auto")`` (US alias ``recolor``) —
  recommended single entry point for chart recolouring.  ``by="auto"``
  dispatches to per-point colouring on pie / doughnut / pie-of-pie
  variants and per-series colouring otherwise.  Closes the
  "apply_palette doesn't work on doughnuts" footgun.

- ``Chart.line_color`` (write-only) — pins axis line and gridline
  colours in one assignment, the line-side counterpart to
  ``text_color``.  Skips axes that don't exist on pie / doughnut, and
  never materialises gridlines that aren't already there.

- ``Chart.apply_dark_theme(text=..., line=...)`` — one-call wrapper
  over ``text_color`` + ``line_color``.

- ``slide.shapes.add_picture(..., anchor=..., margin=..., container=...)``
  (and same kwargs on ``add_shape`` / ``add_textbox``) — anchor-aware
  positioning for branding elements.  ``anchor="bottom-right"`` plus
  a ``margin`` collapses the add → measure → reposition idiom to one
  call, with ``container=`` controlling whether the anchor is
  relative to the slide or to a parent shape.

- ``slide.shapes.add_table(..., style="clean")`` — disables every
  inherited table-style flag at construction so custom borders /
  fills render consistently across PowerPoint and LibreOffice.

- ``power_pptx.add_kpi_card`` / ``power_pptx.add_progress_bar`` —
  shape-level building blocks layered beneath the slide-level
  recipes.  Return small dataclasses (``KpiCard``, ``ProgressBar``)
  exposing the constituent shapes so callers can compose them into
  mixed layouts.

- Top-level imports — ``add_plotly_figure``, ``add_matplotlib_figure``,
  ``add_svg_figure``, ``add_html_figure``, ``FigureBackendUnavailable``,
  ``add_kpi_card``, ``add_progress_bar``, ``add_gauge``,
  ``add_status_pill``, ``add_stat_strip``, ``add_article_card``, plus
  the matching ``KpiCard`` / ``ProgressBar`` / ``Gauge`` / ``StatusPill``
  / ``StatStrip`` / ``ArticleCard`` dataclasses are importable from
  ``power_pptx`` directly (previously buried under
  ``power_pptx.design.figures`` / ``.components``).

- ``slide.shapes.lint_group_scope(name=None)`` — context manager
  that auto-tags every shape added inside the ``with`` block with
  the same ``lint_group``. Auto-generates a ``"design-group-N"``
  name when omitted. Lifts the existing ``shape.lint_group``
  mechanic out of "discoverable only via the docstring" into a
  first-class API. The ``ShapeCollision`` lint message now also
  appends a one-line tip recommending it when both shapes are
  untagged.

- ``power_pptx.formats`` — number-format string helpers that hide
  Excel's format-string syntax behind named functions: ``currency``,
  ``percent``, ``decimal``, ``thousands``, ``scientific``, ``date``.
  Use them with ``data_labels.number_format`` and
  ``cell.text_frame.text`` callsites.

- ``DataLabels.collision_strategy = "auto" | "shrink" | "compact"`` —
  three opinionated strategies for handling overlapping data labels
  on bar / column charts. ``"auto"`` shrinks font and drops
  ``gapWidth`` to 60 only on multi-series + ≥5-category plots;
  ``"compact"`` always applies both; ``"shrink"`` only shrinks the
  font. For real layout-aware collision avoidance, use
  ``add_plotly_figure`` — Plotly handles it natively.

- ``add_gauge``, ``add_status_pill``, ``add_stat_strip``,
  ``add_article_card`` — additional shape-level building blocks
  alongside ``add_kpi_card`` / ``add_progress_bar``. Each returns a
  small dataclass exposing the constituent shapes for further
  per-deck tweaks and tags the stack with ``lint_group``.

- ``BaseShape.animate(entry=, exit=, emphasis=, trigger=,
  delay_ms=, duration_ms=, direction=)`` — constrained-subset
  façade over the existing ``power_pptx.animation`` API. Pass
  exactly one of ``entry`` / ``exit`` / ``emphasis`` and the
  matching preset name. For animation types not covered, drop
  down to ``Entrance`` / ``Exit`` / ``Emphasis`` directly.

Test infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``tests/test_powerpoint_strict_validation.py`` — deck-level scan
  that constructs a deck with every implemented chart type, saves
  to bytes, and walks every XML part looking for stricter-than-spec
  patterns PowerPoint rejects but the OOXML schema accepts. Catches
  the ``<a:endParaRPr/>`` regression today; the scaffold is
  reusable for additional strict-validator rules we discover.

Behaviour changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``slide.shapes.add_chart(BAR_*, ...)`` now defaults the category
  axis to ``reverse_order=True`` so ``["A", "B", "C"]`` renders with
  ``A`` at the top — matching natural reading order.  Column charts
  retain their default left-to-right ordering, and ``BAR_OF_PIE``
  (a pie variant) is excluded.  Override post-creation with
  ``chart.category_axis.reverse_order = False`` for the legacy
  ordering.

- ``Chart.apply_palette`` emits a ``UserWarning`` when called on a
  pie / doughnut chart and routes through ``color_by_category``,
  which is almost always what the caller meant.  Use
  ``Chart.recolour`` for explicit, warning-free dispatch.


2.5.0 (2026-05-01)
++++++++++++++++++

End-to-end pass over the IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md punch list.  Smooths
the most common authoring footguns for both human and LLM-driven
deck generation; all changes are additive except where called out.

New APIs
~~~~~~~~

- ``Chart.shape`` — returns the parent ``GraphicFrame``, populated
  on first access via ``GraphicFrame.chart`` so callers don't have
  to keep the ``add_chart`` return value around.  Reach for this
  instead of ``chart.element.getparent().getparent()`` when
  animating, measuring, or restyling the chart's parent shape.

- ``TextFrame.set_paragraph_defaults(font_name=None, size=None,
  bold=None, italic=None, color=None)`` — fills any *unset* font
  properties on every paragraph and run in the frame.  Explicit per-run overrides
  (including theme-coloured runs) survive verbatim.  Collapses the
  six-lines-per-paragraph branding ritual into one call.

- ``Slide.lint_group_overlaps(*shapes, name=None)`` — convenience
  over ``lint_group`` that auto-generates a unique-on-the-slide
  group name (``design-group-N``).  Returns the chosen name so
  callers can reuse it later.

- ``power_pptx._color.coerce_color`` — internal helper exported for
  third-party integrations that want the same "color-like" coercion
  applied at every public boundary.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Color inputs are uniform across every public setter.**
  ``shape.fill.fore_color.rgb``, ``Chart.text_color``,
  ``linear_gradient``, ``gradient``, and friends now all accept hex
  strings (with or without ``#``), ``RGBColor`` instances, and
  3-tuples of ints interchangeably.  No more ``hex_rgb`` shims in
  user code.  Floats / numeric strings / ``bool`` inside a 3-tuple
  are explicitly rejected so the contract stays tight.

- ``FillFormat.gradient(angle=...)`` now mirrors
  ``linear_gradient(angle=...)`` for symmetry.  Linear-only;
  passing ``angle=`` with a non-linear ``kind`` raises
  ``ValueError``.

- ``apply_quick_layout`` accepts ``legend_position`` as either an
  ``XL_LEGEND_POSITION`` member, an integer enum value (preserving
  the historical numeric form), or its lowercase string name
  (``"right"``, ``"left"``, ``"top"``, ``"bottom"``, ``"corner"``).

- ``Presentation.set_transition(kind=...)`` no longer silently
  clobbers per-slide overrides.  Slides that already have an
  explicit ``slide.transition.kind`` (including
  ``MSO_TRANSITION_TYPE.NONE`` — an explicit "no transition") are
  preserved by default; pass ``force=True`` to restore the old
  "force every slide" behaviour.  ``duration``,
  ``advance_on_click``, and ``advance_after`` are unaffected.
  ``kind=None`` still wipes every slide so the existing "clear all"
  idiom keeps working.

- ``SlideLintReport.auto_fix()`` now handles ``TextOverflow``
  alongside ``OffSlide`` and ``OffGridDrift``.  The fix flips the
  offending text frame's ``auto_size`` to
  ``MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` so PowerPoint shrinks the
  runs at render time; frames with an explicit auto-size are
  respected.  This is the single biggest lever for "lint-or-die"
  pipelines on runtime-supplied text.

- Linter heuristic tuning:

  - ``OffGridDrift`` default tolerance relaxed from 0.01" to 0.05".
    ``Inches(0.6)`` divider next to ``Inches(0.62)`` eyebrow no
    longer fires on every section header.
  - ``TextOverflow`` uses a tighter 0.45× character-width
    multiplier for short single-line strings (≤ 20 chars) — fixes
    the false positive on small badges / pills at 9pt.
  - ``ShapeCollision`` auto-suppresses the canonical layered-design
    pattern (smaller shape strictly contained in a larger shape and
    drawn on top).  Equal-bbox pairs still classify as ``matched``
    so duplicate-rectangle bugs remain auditable.

- ``RGBColor.from_string`` now emits ``DeprecationWarning`` on call.
  ``RGBColor.from_hex`` is the supported parser (it accepts hex
  with or without a leading ``#``).  Internal call sites switched
  to ``from_hex`` so the warning only fires in user code.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``docs/user/common-pitfalls.rst`` — covers colour coercion,
  transition ordering, recipe → blank layout, ``chart.shape``,
  animation experimental status, and the linter's behaviour
  changes in one place.

- ``power_pptx.animation`` is now flagged **experimental** in the
  module docstring, the bundled skill (``references/animations.md``),
  and ``docs/user/animation.rst``.  Animation timing XML
  round-trips through the OOXML schema and renders correctly via
  LibreOffice, but does not currently play in PowerPoint slideshow
  mode (animated shapes sit at 10–15% opacity and snap to fully
  visible all at once).  Slides combining entrance animations with
  a Morph transition can additionally trigger PowerPoint's
  "Repair?" dialog.  Use slide *transitions* until this is fixed.

- Bundled Claude skill updated: SKILL.md gains a "do not generate
  animation calls" house rule, refreshed pitfalls list, and a
  pointer at the new ``references/real-world-decks.md``.

Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CI gains a ``pyflakes examples/`` static-check job and a
  ``examples/real_world/build_all.py`` smoke build, so the public
  surface stays green against the ten Fortune-500-style example
  decks.


2.4.0 (2026-04-30)
++++++++++++++++++

Animation ergonomics, gradient/alpha discoverability, recipe bug fixes,
and a bundled Claude skill.  All additive; nothing removed.

New APIs
~~~~~~~~

- ``slide.animations.group()`` — context manager that animates every
  effect added in the block as a single visual cluster (first effect
  ``AFTER_PREVIOUS``; subsequent ones default to ``WITH_PREVIOUS``).
  Use this for sub-shapes that belong to the same card/row/panel.
  Drastically reduces the per-slide timing-tree size — and the
  perceived lag — relative to the same effects added independently.

- ``SlideAnimations`` is now iterable, supports ``len()``, and exposes
  ``clear()``.  Iteration yields read-only ``AnimationEntry`` views
  with ``kind``, ``preset``, ``trigger``, ``shape_id``, ``shape``,
  ``duration``, ``delay``, and a ``remove()`` method.  Useful for
  re-animating, copying animations between slides, and debugging why
  something didn't fire.  ``purge_orphans`` is unchanged.

- ``fill.linear_gradient(start, end, angle=...)`` (and a multi-stop
  list form) — one-line gradient helper that wraps ``gradient()`` +
  ``gradient_stops`` for the 90% case.  ``gradient_angle``'s docstring
  now spells out the OOXML convention (``0`` left→right, ``90``
  top→bottom, ``180`` right→left, ``270`` bottom→top).

- ``DesignTokens.with_overrides(...)`` now accepts nested-dict input
  in addition to dotted keys (``{"palette": {"primary": "#FF6600"}}``
  is equivalent to ``{"palette.primary": "#FF6600"}``).  Mixed input
  is allowed.

Bundled Claude skill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``power-pptx`` Claude Code skill (``SKILL.md`` + reference docs)
  ships inside the package at ``power_pptx/skill/``.  Install it with
  ``python -m power_pptx.skill install`` (or the ``power-pptx-skill``
  console script).  Pip-installing power-pptx is now sufficient to
  make the skill available wherever the library runs.

Recipe bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``figure_slide`` correctly routes inline SVG markup that contains a
  namespace URL (``xmlns="http://..."``) to the SVG embedder rather
  than mis-classifying it as a file path and raising
  ``FileNotFoundError``.

- ``code_slide``'s Pygments highlighting renders ``Token.Operator``
  and ``Token.Punctuation`` in the same colour as plain code text,
  so member-access dots (``optimiser.zero_grad``) stay legible on
  light-surface themes (previously they faded into the background).

``from_spec`` ergonomics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Recipe layouts now reject unknown spec keys (``ValueError``) instead
  of silently dropping them.  Catches typos like ``"subtitlz"`` or
  ``"millestones"`` that previously yielded a slide missing the
  intended content.

- ``"comparison"`` is now an unambiguous alias for the comparison
  recipe.  Use ``"comparison_layout"`` to opt in to the
  placeholder-based layout from the underlying template.


2.3.0 (2026-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

Two P0 fixes, six new recipes, a meaningful lint-noise reduction,
and figure-embedding adapters for Plotly / Matplotlib / HTML.  All
changes are additive; no existing API was removed.

P0 fixes
~~~~~~~~

- ``render_slide_thumbnails`` no longer silently drops slides 2..N
  on stock LibreOffice 7+ (whose ``--convert-to png`` filter only
  emits the first slide).  When the PNG path under-produces, the
  renderer transparently falls back to ``--convert-to pdf`` plus a
  per-page split via ``pdftoppm`` (Poppler) or ``pypdfium2``.  New
  ``strategy="auto" | "png" | "pdf"`` and ``dpi=`` knobs.
- ``SlideAnimations.add(kind, preset, shape, **kwargs)`` is now a
  documented entry point — the class was publicly exported but had
  no polymorphic ``add()`` method, leaving data-driven callers to
  build their own dispatcher.

API ergonomics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``MotionPath.svg(slide, shape, "M 0 0 H 100 V 100", viewbox=...)``
  accepts standard SVG path syntax (M/m L/l H/h V/v C/c Q/q Z/z) and
  maps coordinates into OOXML's unit-square space.  ``MotionPath.custom``
  remains the OOXML-syntax escape hatch.
- ``kpi_slide`` delta auto-detects fraction-vs-raw: ``0.27`` →
  ``+27%``, ``14.0`` → ``+14.0`` (was silently ``+1400%``).  String
  ``delta`` and the new ``delta_text`` field pass through verbatim.
- ``quote_slide`` strips a leading hyphen / en-dash / em-dash from
  ``attribution`` so callers who already wrote ``"— Person"`` don't
  get ``"— — Person"``.
- Every recipe docstring now lists the palette / typography /
  shadow / radii slots it consumes — no more grepping the source.

Six new recipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``section_divider`` — full-bleed cover with an optional eyebrow
  caption and ``progress=(3, 7)`` row of progress dots.
- ``chart_slide`` — line / line_markers / bar / column / pie /
  doughnut / area, with ``chart_palette=`` (named preset, colour
  list, or token-derived in palette priority order), plus
  ``legend=`` / ``smooth=`` / ``data_labels=`` toggles.
- ``table_slide`` — header band + banded rows; ``widths=`` (fractions
  or absolute Lengths), per-column ``aligns=``, optional
  ``totals=`` footer row.
- ``code_slide`` — monospace panel with optional Pygments syntax
  highlighting.
- ``timeline_slide`` — horizontal rail with alternating-side
  date / label pairs and ``done`` marker tinting.
- ``comparison_slide`` — matched two-column L/R rows.
- ``figure_slide`` — embed a Plotly Figure, Matplotlib Figure, SVG
  blob, HTML snippet, or image path; dispatches by type.

Lint signal-to-noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implicit name-prefix grouping: shapes named ``card.bg`` /
  ``card.label`` are auto-grouped under ``card`` so the linter
  treats the pair as one logical unit without per-shape tagging.
  ``shape.lint_group = ""`` opts a shape out of the implicit group.
- ``ShapeCollision`` ``kind="matched"`` reclassified ERROR → INFO.
  Identical bounds are almost always intentional layering (badge
  + number, button + label); the kind is preserved on the issue
  for callers who really want to filter on it.
- ``slide.lint(disable=["ShapeCollision"], min_severity="warning")``
  filters issues at the lint level rather than after the fact.
- ``auto_fix()`` now also clamps shape *size* when the shape is
  larger than the slide — translation alone could never converge,
  so the previous fixer was a silent no-op for oversize shapes.
  Multiple OffSlide issues on the same shape coalesce into one fix.
- ``SlideLintReport.fingerprints()`` returns 12-char content
  digests suitable for CI baselining — re-runs after layout
  changes only surface newly-introduced issues.

Design system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``DesignTokens.from_preset("modern_light" | "modern_dark" |
  "corporate_navy" | "vibrant")`` ships ready-to-use token sets so
  callers don't have to invent a brand from scratch.
- ``tokens.with_overrides({"palette.primary": "#FF6600",
  "typography.heading.size": Pt(40)})`` layers dotted-path tweaks
  onto a base set without forking it.
- ``kpi_slide`` and ``code_slide`` now apply ``shadows.card`` and
  ``radii.md`` via a shared ``_apply_card_styling`` helper, so the
  card-style backdrops actually reflect the design system instead
  of relying on hard-coded defaults.

compose.from_spec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Recipe dispatch: layouts ``kpi`` / ``chart`` / ``table`` / ``code`` /
  ``timeline`` / ``comparison`` / ``quote`` / ``image_hero`` /
  ``section_divider`` / ``figure`` / ``title_recipe`` /
  ``bullets_recipe`` route to the matching ``recipes`` function.
  Legacy placeholder layouts (``title``, ``bullets``, ``two_column``,
  …) keep working for branded-template flows.
- ``tokens`` spec key accepts presets, YAML paths, inline dicts, or
  ``{"preset": name, "overrides": {...}}``.
- ``vars`` spec key + ``{{name}}`` interpolation across every
  string in the spec, including dotted paths into nested mappings.
  Unknown names raise rather than silently rendering as the
  literal placeholder.
- ``compose.from_yaml(path, vars={...})``: direct YAML entry point.

Figure embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New ``power_pptx.design.figures`` module with optional-dep adapters:

- ``add_plotly_figure(slide, fig, ...)`` — renders via
  ``fig.to_image()`` (needs ``plotly + kaleido``); SVG when
  ``cairosvg`` is present, PNG otherwise.
- ``add_matplotlib_figure(slide, fig, ...)`` — renders via
  ``fig.savefig()`` (needs ``matplotlib``); same SVG / PNG split.
- ``add_svg_figure(slide, svg, ...)`` — wraps the existing
  ``add_svg_picture`` so every figure kind shares one entry shape.
- ``add_html_figure(slide, html, ...)`` — proxy for HTML
  embedding (PowerPoint has no native HTML surface): screenshots
  the rendered DOM via headless Chromium (needs ``playwright`` +
  ``playwright install chromium``).

Each adapter imports its dependency lazily and raises
``FigureBackendUnavailable`` (subclass of ``ImportError``) naming
the install command when the dep is missing.

Tooling
~~~~~~~

- New ``release-on-version-bump.yml`` workflow auto-creates a
  ``vX.Y.Z`` tag and a GitHub release when a merge to ``master``
  changes ``power_pptx.__version__`` to a value with no matching
  tag.  Chains into the existing ``publish.yml`` for PyPI upload.


2.2.0 (2026-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

Two additive lint detector changes scoped from the post-2.1.1
follow-up — both signal-to-noise improvements on layered production
decks.  No behavior change for existing callers: the new
classification surfaces extra fields on existing issues, and the new
geometry mode is opt-in.

ShapeCollision now scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ShapeCollision`` issues carry a ``score: float`` in ``[0.0, 1.0]``
and a ``kind: str`` in ``{"incidental", "partial", "matched"}``,
emitted alongside the pre-existing ``intersection_area`` /
``intersection_pct`` / ``groups`` fields.

- ``incidental`` — small shape fully inside a larger one (the
  card-on-panel pattern).  Severity drops to ``INFO``.
- ``partial`` — partial overlap, neither contains the other.
  Severity stays ``WARNING``.
- ``matched`` — near-identical bbox (within 5% on each axis) and
  heavy overlap (>80%).  Severity raised to ``ERROR`` — almost
  certainly a duplicate or copy-paste bug.

The score combines containment (pulls toward incidental), size ratio
(closer to 1.0 pulls up), and overlap percentage (pulls up).
``lint_group`` suppression still runs *before* scoring — a tagged
group is intentional by definition and never scores.

The classification is also surfaced in ``report.summary()``: each
``ShapeCollision`` line now carries ``[kind=…, score=…]`` so readers
can spot the genuine bugs without re-running the detector.

Effect-bleed-aware geometry (opt-in)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``slide.lint(...)`` and ``lint_slide(slide, ...)`` accept a new
``include_effect_bleed: bool = False`` keyword argument.  When
``True``, the ``OffSlide`` and ``ShapeCollision`` detectors widen
each shape's bbox by its shadow's blur radius before checking
geometry — catching the case where a panel's raw bbox sits inside the
slide but its shadow visually bleeds past the edge.

Bleed-only triggers (where the raw bbox stays clean and only the
inflated bbox crosses the boundary) are emitted as
``OffSlideShadow`` / ``ShapeCollisionShadow`` subclasses, so callers
can opt out specifically via ``shape.lint_skip = {"OffSlideShadow"}``
without silencing real geometry warnings.

The inflation model is the simple one in this release — each side
extended by ``blur_radius / 2``.  Directional projection
(``distance × direction``) and other effects (glow, soft-edges,
reflection) are TODOs for a follow-up.  ``GraphicFrame.shadow ==
None`` (added in 2.1.1) is handled gracefully — the helper falls
back to the raw bbox.

Default behavior is unchanged; existing decks see no new warnings
unless they opt in to ``include_effect_bleed=True``.


2.1.1 (2026-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes and ergonomic improvements.

OOXML correctness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both items below address the "PowerPoint found a problem with content.
Repaired and removed it" prompt on open.

- ``chart.legend.position = XL_LEGEND_POSITION.RIGHT`` now writes
  ``<c:legendPos val="r"/>`` explicitly.  ``CT_LegendPos.val`` is an
  ``OptionalAttribute`` whose setter strips the attribute when the
  assigned value matches the OOXML default ("r"), producing a bare
  ``<c:legendPos/>`` element that PowerPoint's strict parser rejects.
  PowerPoint then "repairs" the chart by deleting it.  The bug only
  manifested for the default position — every other legend position
  wrote correctly because they didn't trip the strip-on-default branch.

- Fix the same "Repaired and removed it" prompt on decks that used
  ``shape.lint_group``, ``slide.lint_group(...)``, or
  ``slide.design_group(...)``.  The 2.1.0 implementation stored the
  group name as a custom-namespaced *attribute* on each shape's
  ``p:cNvPr`` element.  ``CT_NonVisualDrawingProps`` has no
  ``xsd:anyAttribute`` in the OOXML schema, so PowerPoint's strict
  validator (notably on macOS) flagged every tagged shape as malformed
  and stripped its non-visual properties on open.

  Lint metadata now lives in an ``a:extLst/a:ext`` extension element
  under ``cNvPr``, the schema-sanctioned mechanism PowerPoint preserves
  verbatim.  Decks saved with 2.1.0 are read transparently — the legacy
  attribute is migrated to the new layout the next time the value is
  written.

Ergonomic improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``GraphicFrame.shadow`` now returns ``None`` (previously raised
  ``NotImplementedError``).  Probing every shape on a slide for shadow
  info no longer needs a ``try/except`` wrapper; ``if shape.shadow is
  None`` is the supported "no facade available" check.

- ``SlideLintReport.auto_fix()`` now refreshes ``report.issues`` after
  applying fixes, so the residual punch list is just ``report.issues``
  rather than a second ``slide.lint()`` call.  Skipped on
  ``dry_run=True`` (nothing changed on the slide).

- ``Chart.text_color = "#FFFFFF"`` (or ``RGBColor`` / ``(r, g, b)``
  tuple) now pins the colour across ``chart.font``,
  ``chart.legend.font`` (when present), ``chart.chart_title`` runs
  (when present), and every plot's ``data_labels.font`` (when
  enabled) — the most common copy-paste in dark-deck authoring.
  Write-only; read individual fonts directly.

- ``ShapeCollision.groups`` exposes the ``lint_group`` tag of each
  colliding shape as a ``(group_a, group_b)`` tuple.  Lets callers
  triage "intentional overlap I forgot to tag" (one or both ``None``)
  vs. "genuine layout bug" (different non-``None`` tags) at a glance
  in ``report.summary()``.

- ``shape.lint_skip = {"MinFontSize", …}`` opts an individual shape
  out of named lint checks — the natural counterpart to ``lint_group``
  for "I know this one's fine; stop warning."  Cross-shape issues
  (``ShapeCollision``, ``ZOrderAnomaly``) are only suppressed when
  *both* shapes opt out.  Persists alongside ``lint_group`` in the
  ``cNvPr/extLst/ext`` extension block.


2.1.0 (2026-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

Feature release.  No breaking changes; everything from 2.0.0 continues
to work unchanged.  Headline additions span the linter, tables, charts,
animations, and the theme.

Lint
~~~~

- ``shape.lint_group`` / ``slide.lint_group(name, *shapes)`` /
  ``slide.design_group(name)`` context manager — the cheapest fix for
  the noisiest part of the linter.  Shapes that share a non-empty
  ``lint_group`` are allowed to overlap without producing a
  :class:`~power_pptx.lint.ShapeCollision` warning, so intentional
  layering (KPI cards, accent bars, overlaid labels) no longer drowns
  out real signal.  The tag is stored as a custom-namespaced attribute
  on ``p:cNvPr`` and round-trips through power-pptx save/load.

- Five new lint checks:

  * :class:`~power_pptx.lint.MinFontSize` — flags any text run below the
    legibility threshold (default 9pt).
  * :class:`~power_pptx.lint.OffGridDrift` — detects shapes whose left
    or top edge is slightly off a column/row grid that several other
    shapes hit cleanly.
  * :class:`~power_pptx.lint.LowContrast` — computes the WCAG contrast
    ratio between text and resolved-background fill, warns below 4.5:1.
    Resolves only solid RGB fills (theme colors and gradients are
    skipped silently, so the check is noise-free by construction).
  * :class:`~power_pptx.lint.ZOrderAnomaly` — finds filled shapes drawn
    above shapes they visually contain (the inner shape would be
    hidden at render time).
  * :class:`~power_pptx.lint.MasterPlaceholderCollision` — flags a
    non-placeholder shape sitting at exactly the position of a layout
    placeholder it should likely have inherited from instead.

- ``SlideLintReport.auto_fix()`` now also snaps ``OffGridDrift``
  offenders onto the dominant grid line — the Tier-3 auto-fix from the
  hierarchy.

Tables
~~~~~~

- ``row.borders`` / ``col.borders`` shorthand — apply ``left`` /
  ``right`` / ``top`` / ``bottom`` / ``outer`` borders to every cell in
  a row or column with a single call.  Mirrors the existing per-cell
  ``cell.borders``.

- ``Table.banded_rows`` / ``Table.banded_cols`` — friendlier aliases
  for ``horz_banding`` / ``vert_banding`` that match PowerPoint's UI
  vocabulary.

- ``Table.fit_to_box(...)`` — for runtime-driven tables: walks every
  populated cell, computes the per-cell best-fit font size against the
  cell's own width and row height (margins respected), and applies the
  smallest of those uniformly so the grid reads as one coherent size.

- ``cell.text_frame.fit_text`` now measures against the cell's own
  ``width`` / ``height`` (it was measuring against the whole table
  before, giving meaningless results).  ``_Cell.width`` / ``height``
  properties are exposed for the same reason.

Charts
~~~~~~

- ``apply_quick_layout`` accepts keyword overrides on top of named
  presets::

      chart.apply_quick_layout("title_legend_right", title_text="Q4 ARR")
      chart.apply_quick_layout(
          "title_axes_legend_bottom",
          value_axis_title_text="Revenue (£m)",
          has_major_gridlines=False,
      )

- ``Chart.color_by_category(palette)`` recolors each *data point*
  instead of each series — the helper for stacked-bar / stacked-column
  charts where you want each category segment to read as a discrete
  color.

- ``GraphicFrame.render_to_png(...)`` renders the parent slide via
  headless LibreOffice and crops to the frame's bbox, so a chart or
  table can be exported as a standalone PNG without taking the whole
  slide.  Reuses the existing :func:`~power_pptx.render.render_slide_thumbnail`
  infrastructure; requires Pillow (already a dependency) and
  ``soffice`` on PATH.

Animations
~~~~~~~~~~

- ``slide.animations.typewriter([s1, s2, s3], delay_between_ms=200)``
  one-line replacement for the manual ``with sequence(): for s ...``
  loop.  Defaults to the ``"wipe"`` preset; any entrance preset can be
  passed.

- Easing curves on :meth:`SlideAnimations.add_entrance` (and friends):
  pass ``easing="ease_in"`` / ``"ease_out"`` / ``"ease_in_out"`` /
  ``"linear"`` for a preset, or ``easing=(accel, decel)`` for an
  explicit ``<p:cTn>``-level acceleration / deceleration pair.

- ``BaseShape.delete()`` — removes the shape *and* purges any orphan
  animation entries that targeted it.  Equivalent to the manual
  ``shape._element.getparent().remove(shape._element)`` idiom but with
  the cleanup pass that the manual idiom misses.
  ``slide.animations.purge_orphans()`` is exposed publicly for callers
  that delete shapes by other means.

Theme
~~~~~

- ``Theme.apply(other, rebind_shape_colors=True, presentation=prs)`` —
  re-skinning a deck no longer leaves orphan literal colors.  Every
  shape whose hardcoded RGB matches a slot in the *old* (pre-swap)
  palette is rewritten to point at that theme slot.  Returns the
  number of color references rebound.

- ``Theme.embed_font(presentation, path, typeface=..., weight=...)`` —
  bundles a TTF/OTF into the deck under ``/ppt/fonts/`` and registers
  it in ``<p:embeddedFontLst>`` so the deck travels with its font and
  doesn't fall back to Calibri on the customer's machine.  The font is
  embedded unobfuscated (content type ``application/x-fontdata``);
  PowerPoint 2007+ accepts this form.  The fully-obfuscated form per
  ECMA-376 §15.2.13 is on the roadmap.

- ``Slide.color_variant`` — per-slide light / dark variant via
  ``<p:clrMapOvr>``.  ``slide.color_variant = "dark"`` swaps
  ``bg`` / ``tx`` mappings without changing the deck theme;
  ``"light"`` (the default) restores master inheritance.
  ``Slide.set_clr_map_override(...)`` for arbitrary attribute remappings.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``power_pptx.text.layout.TextFitter`` no longer raises when text
  genuinely cannot fit at any point size; the predicate now treats
  unfittable input as "doesn't fit" so :meth:`best_fit_font_size`
  returns ``None`` cleanly.  Surfaces with ``cell.text_frame.fit_text``
  on tiny cells with very long text.

- ``tests/text/test_fonts.py`` resets the ``FontFiles`` class-level
  cache in its ``find_fixture`` so the suite is order-independent.

Tests
~~~~~

3,140 passing (up from 3,087 in 2.0.0): 53 new tests across lint,
tables, charts, animations, and theme.


2.0.0 (2026-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

Breaking change: the importable package was renamed from ``pptx`` to
``power_pptx`` so that ``power-pptx`` and ``python-pptx`` can be
installed side-by-side without colliding on the top-level ``pptx``
module.  Update imports accordingly::

    # before (1.x)
    from pptx import Presentation
    from pptx.util import Inches

    # after (2.0+)
    from power_pptx import Presentation
    from power_pptx.util import Inches

No public API behavior changed in this release; everything that used to
live under ``pptx.*`` now lives under ``power_pptx.*`` with identical
signatures.  The PyPI distribution name (``power-pptx``) is unchanged.


1.1.0 (2026-04-28)
++++++++++++++++++

This is the inaugural release under the ``power-pptx`` distribution name
on PyPI.  It is a drop-in replacement for ``python-pptx`` 1.0.2:
``import power_pptx`` continues to work and existing user code is unaffected.
It bundles every feature from Phases 1 through 10 of the fork's roadmap —
visual effects, animations, transitions, theme reader/writer, JSON
authoring, the layout linter, design tokens and slide recipes, chart
palettes and quick layouts, slide thumbnails, and more.

The Sphinx documentation has also been rebuilt: every new module ships
with a user-guide chapter and an API-reference page, the substitution
table covers every public class added by the fork, and Read-the-Docs
builds now fail on Sphinx warnings.

The full per-phase changelog follows; the project changes summary is
collected near the end under "Project changes".

Phase 9 — design-system layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``power_pptx.design.tokens.DesignTokens``: source-agnostic container for
  brand tokens — ``palette`` (str → ``RGBColor``), ``typography``
  (``TypographyToken`` with ``family``/``size``/``bold``/``italic``/
  ``color``), ``radii`` and ``spacings`` (str → ``Length``), and
  ``shadows`` (``ShadowToken``).  Constructors: ``from_dict``,
  ``from_yaml`` (optional ``pyyaml``), and ``from_pptx`` (extracts
  accent palette + major/minor fonts from a deck's theme).
  ``DesignTokens.merge(other)`` layers an override token set on top of
  a base.

- ``shape.style``: token-resolving ``ShapeStyle`` facade exposed on
  every shape.  Setters fan out to the low-level proxies::

      shape.style.fill   = tokens.palette["primary"]
      shape.style.line   = tokens.palette["primary"]
      shape.style.shadow = tokens.shadows["card"]
      shape.style.font   = tokens.typography["body"]
      shape.style.text_color = tokens.palette["neutral"]

  ``ShadowToken`` assignment leaves unset fields untouched so partial
  tokens are non-destructive; ``None`` clears the corresponding effect.

- ``power_pptx.design.recipes``: opinionated parameterized slide
  constructors.  Five recipes are included — ``title_slide``,
  ``bullet_slide``, ``kpi_slide``, ``quote_slide``, and
  ``image_hero_slide`` — each taking the host ``Presentation``, the
  recipe-specific content kwargs (e.g. ``title=``, ``bullets=``,
  ``kpis=``), an optional ``DesignTokens`` for palette/typography
  resolution, and an optional ``transition=`` name.  Recipes use the
  ``Blank`` layout and place every shape themselves so the rendered
  geometry doesn't depend on the host template's master.  ``kpi_slide``
  honors ``palette["positive"]`` / ``palette["negative"]`` when
  tinting deltas (falling back to green/red), and applies
  ``tokens.shadows["card"]`` to each card when present.

- A starter pack of three example token sets — ``modern``, ``classic``,
  and ``editorial`` — lives at ``examples/starter_pack/``.  Each
  module exports both a ``SPEC`` dict (suitable for serialising) and
  a ready-to-use ``TOKENS`` (a built ``DesignTokens``).
  ``examples/starter_pack/build_preview.py`` renders a comparison
  deck per set into ``examples/starter_pack/_out/`` (gitignored).

Phase 10 — additional motion-path presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``power_pptx.animation.MotionPath`` gains five new convenience constructors
  alongside the existing ``line`` / ``custom``: ``diagonal``,
  ``circle`` (closed cubic-bezier loop with a ``clockwise`` flag),
  ``arc`` (quadratic-bezier hop with a configurable ``height``
  fraction), ``zigzag`` (configurable ``segments`` / ``amplitude``),
  and ``spiral`` (configurable ``turns`` and direction).  All
  normalize EMU inputs against the slide's dimensions and route
  through ``slide.animations.add_motion``, so they honor the Phase 5
  trigger model and round-trip cleanly.

Phase 10 — chart palette presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Chart.apply_palette(palette)`` recolors every series in a chart
  from a named built-in preset or an iterable of color-likes,
  independently of ``chart_style``.  Series are recolored in
  declaration order; palettes wrap when the chart has more series
  than colors.

- New module ``power_pptx.chart.palettes`` exposes ``CHART_PALETTES`` (six
  built-in palettes — ``modern``, ``classic``, ``editorial``,
  ``vibrant``, ``monochrome_blue``, ``monochrome_warm``),
  ``palette_names()``, and ``resolve_palette()`` for callers that want
  to share the same color set with non-chart shapes.

- Per-series gradient and pattern fills work out of the box through
  ``chart.series[i].format.fill`` (a regular ``FillFormat``) — locked
  in with regression tests covering the four gradient kinds and
  ``MSO_PATTERN_TYPE`` patterns.

Phase 6 — theme-aware color inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``power_pptx.inherit.resolve_color(color_format, theme=...)`` returns
  the effective ``RGBColor`` for any ``ColorFormat`` (including the
  ``_LazyColorFormat`` proxy returned by ``Font.color`` /
  ``LineFormat.color``).  Explicit RGB colors are returned as-is,
  scheme colors resolve through ``theme.colors[…]``, and unset colors
  return ``None`` without mutating XML.  ``brightness`` is applied by
  blending the resolved RGB toward white or black, mirroring
  PowerPoint's ``lumMod`` / ``lumOff`` model.

Phase 6 — native SVG in ``add_picture``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``slide.shapes.add_svg_picture(svg_file, left, top, width=None,
  height=None, *, png_fallback=None)`` embeds both an
  ``<asvg:svgBlip>`` (Office 2016+ SVG extension) and a PNG fallback
  inside the same ``<a:blip>``.  When ``png_fallback`` is omitted the
  SVG is rasterised through the optional ``cairosvg`` dependency; a
  clear ``CairoSvgUnavailable`` error guides callers to install it or
  supply their own fallback.  ``image/svg+xml`` is registered as a
  first-class image content type so SVG parts round-trip cleanly.

Phase 7 — ``power_pptx.compose`` package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``power_pptx.compose`` is now a real package re-exporting ``from_spec``,
  ``import_slide``, and ``apply_template`` from a single import path::

      from power_pptx.compose import from_spec, import_slide, apply_template

  The implementations live in private submodules
  (``power_pptx.compose.from_spec``, ``power_pptx._slide_importer``,
  ``power_pptx._template_applier``).  Existing imports (``from power_pptx.compose
  import from_spec``) are unchanged.

Phase 10 — chart quick layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Chart.apply_quick_layout(layout)`` toggles title / legend /
  axis-title / gridline visibility in opinionated combinations.  Ten
  built-in presets ship in ``power_pptx.chart.quick_layouts``
  (``title_legend_right``, ``title_legend_bottom``,
  ``title_legend_top``, ``title_legend_left``, ``title_no_legend``,
  ``no_title_no_legend``, ``title_axes_legend_right``,
  ``title_axes_legend_bottom``, ``minimal``, ``dense``); custom layouts
  can be supplied as a dict spec.

Phase 10 — slide-thumbnail renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``power_pptx.render`` module with
  ``render_slide_thumbnails(prs, ...)`` and
  ``render_slide_thumbnail(slide, ...)``, plus convenience methods
  ``Presentation.render_thumbnails()`` and ``Slide.render_thumbnail()``.
  Drives a headless ``soffice --headless --convert-to png`` shell-out
  to rasterise slides; supports custom binary path
  (``soffice_bin=`` or ``POWER_PPTX_SOFFICE`` env var), per-slide
  selection (``slide_indexes=``), bytes-or-paths return
  (``return_bytes=True``), custom output directory, and a configurable
  timeout.  Raises ``ThumbnailRendererUnavailable`` with an install
  hint when ``soffice`` isn't on PATH and ``ThumbnailRendererError``
  on conversion failure.

Phase 6 — text-fit estimator on Linux / minimal runtimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``TextFrame.fit_text()`` now works on Linux and on runtimes without
  the requested font installed.  ``FontFiles._font_directories()``
  enumerates ``/usr/share/fonts``, ``/usr/local/share/fonts``,
  ``/usr/share/fonts/truetype``, ``~/.fonts``, and
  ``~/.local/share/fonts``; unrecognised platforms now return an empty
  directory list instead of raising ``OSError``.  When no matching
  system font can be located, ``_best_fit_font_size`` falls back to
  ``ImageFont.load_default(size=...)`` (Pillow ≥10.1, with a graceful
  fallback to the unsized bitmap default on older Pillow), so a call
  with no ``font_file=`` argument produces a usable estimate rather
  than a ``KeyError``.  Malformed font files encountered during the
  directory scan are skipped silently.


Phase 8 — 3D primitives and SmartArt text substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``shape.three_d`` accessor: ``ThreeDFormat`` facade exposing
  ``bevel_top``/``bevel_bottom`` (``_BevelFormat`` with ``preset``,
  ``width``, ``height``), ``extrusion_height``, ``extrusion_color``,
  ``contour_width``, ``contour_color``, and ``preset_material``.
  Backed by ``CT_Shape3D`` and ``CT_Scene3D`` element classes in
  ``power_pptx.oxml.dml.three_d``.  ``BevelPreset`` and ``PresetMaterial``
  enumerations added to ``power_pptx.enum.dml``.

- ``slide.smart_art``: ``SmartArtCollection`` providing indexed and
  iterable access to SmartArt graphics on a slide.  Each item is a
  ``SmartArtShape`` with:

  - ``texts`` property — ordered list of node text strings.
  - ``set_text(values, *, strict=True)`` — replaces node text in
    document order without touching layout, style, or colour parts.

  ``DiagramDataPart`` and sibling part classes registered so SmartArt
  ``diagrams/data#.xml``, ``layout#``, ``quickStyle#``, and ``colors#``
  parts are handled as typed ``XmlPart`` subclasses.


Phase 7 — slide composition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Presentation.import_slide(source_slide, merge_master='dedupe'|'clone')``:
  clones a slide from any ``Presentation`` into the receiver.  Copies
  the slide part and all its dependencies (images, charts, media,
  notes, SmartArt diagram parts, …).  Master/layout/theme parts are
  either deduped against existing masters (``'dedupe'``) or always
  cloned fresh (``'clone'``).  Slide IDs and partnames are guaranteed
  collision-free.

- ``Presentation.apply_template(path_or_stream)``: re-points every
  slide's layout/master/theme at masters from a ``.potx`` or ``.pptx``
  template.  Slide content is preserved.  Layout matching: name → type
  → first layout.  Unreferenced old masters/layouts/themes are dropped
  from the saved package.


Project changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Renamed the PyPI distribution from ``python-pptx-next`` to
  ``power-pptx``. The importable package remains ``pptx``.
- Repository moved to ``codehalwell/power-pptx``.
- Original ``LICENSE`` (MIT, Steve Canny, 2013) preserved verbatim;
  fork copyright added on a second line per MIT requirements.
- Dropped the vestigial ``pyparsing`` line from ``requirements.txt``;
  it was not in ``pyproject.toml`` runtime deps and is not imported
  anywhere in ``src/pptx/``.
- Added Python 3.13 to the supported-versions classifier list.
- Dropped Python 3.8 (EOL October 2024). Minimum supported version is
  now 3.9, matching ``pyright``'s configured ``pythonVersion``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Sphinx config rebuilt for ``power-pptx``: switched to the
  ``sphinx-rtd-theme``, removed dead upstream-specific hacks, refreshed
  the substitution table, and turned on ``fail_on_warning`` for
  Read-the-Docs builds.
- New user-guide chapters: visual effects, animations, slide
  transitions, layout linter, JSON authoring + cross-presentation
  composition, themes, design-system layer, advanced charts (palettes
  / quick layouts / per-series fills), and slide thumbnails.
- New API reference pages: ``power_pptx.animation``, ``power_pptx.lint``,
  ``power_pptx.compose``, ``power_pptx.theme`` (plus ``power_pptx.inherit.resolve_color``),
  ``power_pptx.design`` (tokens, style, layout, recipes), ``power_pptx.render``,
  ``power_pptx.smart_art``, plus enum pages for ``MSO_LINE_CAP_STYLE``,
  ``MSO_LINE_COMPOUND_STYLE``, ``MSO_LINE_JOIN_STYLE``,
  ``MSO_LINE_END_TYPE``, ``MSO_LINE_END_SIZE``, ``MSO_TRANSITION_TYPE``,
  and ``PP_ANIM_TRIGGER``.
- ``ShadowFormat`` and the ``DrawingML`` reference page surface the
  full Phase 3/6 effect family (``GlowFormat``, ``SoftEdgeFormat``,
  ``BlurFormat``, ``ReflectionFormat``, ``LineEndFormat``,
  ``PictureEffects``).

Deprecations (scheduled for removal in 2.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ShadowFormat.inherit`` now emits a ``DeprecationWarning`` on both
  read and write. Read individual properties (``blur_radius``,
  ``distance``, ``direction``, ``color``) for ``None`` instead.  The
  ``inherit`` property is scheduled for removal in 2.0.
- ``MSO_PATTERN_TYPE.ERCENT_40`` is now an aliased member of
  ``PERCENT_40`` and emits a ``DeprecationWarning`` on access.
- ``shapes.turbo_add_enabled`` setter remains a no-op and emits a
  ``DeprecationWarning`` (shape-id allocation is now always O(1)).

New API
~~~~~~~

- Radial / rectangular / shape-path gradients (Phase 6): ``FillFormat.gradient``
  now accepts a ``kind`` argument.  ``fill.gradient(kind="radial")`` writes a
  ``<a:path path="circle"/>`` shading element; ``"rectangular"`` writes
  ``"rect"``; ``"shape"`` follows the bounding shape.  ``fill.gradient_kind``
  reports the resolved value (``"linear"``/``"radial"``/``"rectangular"``/
  ``"shape"``/``None``).  Switching kinds preserves existing gradient stops.
  ``GradientStops`` is now mutable: ``stops.append(position, color)``,
  ``stops.replace([(pos, color), ...])``, and ``del stops[i]`` (the OOXML
  2-stop minimum is enforced).  ``color`` accepts ``RGBColor``, hex strings
  (with or without leading ``#``), 3-tuples, or ``None`` (placeholder
  ``schemeClr accent1`` color).
- ``power_pptx.design.layout`` (Phase 9): build-time geometry helpers that compute
  ``Box(left, top, width, height)`` rectangles so callers don't eyeball EMUs.
  ``Grid(slide, cols=12, rows=6, gutter=Pt(12), margin=Inches(0.5))`` allocates
  rectangles via ``grid.cell(col=, row=, col_span=, row_span=)`` or applies
  them directly with ``grid.place(shape, ...)``.  ``Stack(direction="vertical"
  | "horizontal", gap=Pt(8), left=, top=, width=, height=)`` walks a running
  cursor via ``stack.next(width=, height=)`` / ``stack.place(shape, ...)``;
  ``stack.reset()`` rewinds.  Pure geometry — no XML is read or mutated until
  the caller invokes a ``place()``.
- ``MotionPath`` (Phase 5): convenience class for adding motion-path
  animations.  ``MotionPath.line(slide, shape, dx, dy)`` accepts EMU
  deltas (typically built with ``Inches(...)``/``Pt(...)``) and
  normalizes them against the slide's dimensions before emitting the
  motion-path attribute, so the *absolute* travel distance is preserved
  across slide sizes.  ``MotionPath.custom(slide, shape, path_str)``
  passes an OOXML motion-path expression through verbatim.  Both
  delegate to ``SlideAnimations.add_motion`` and inherit the trigger /
  delay / duration model from the rest of Phase 5.
- ``SlideAnimations.sequence()`` (Phase 5): context manager that
  groups the contained ``Entrance``/``Exit``/``Emphasis``/``MotionPath``
  effects into a single click-driven chain.  Inside the block, the
  first effect (whose ``trigger`` was not explicitly supplied) fires on
  ``Trigger.ON_CLICK`` (or whatever ``start=`` is passed) and every
  subsequent effect defaults to ``Trigger.AFTER_PREVIOUS``, producing
  effects that play one after another.  Explicit per-call triggers
  still override the sequence default; sequences cannot be nested.
- ``Entrance.fade(slide, text_frame, by_paragraph=True)`` (Phase 5):
  by-paragraph entrance animations.  Accepts a ``TextFrame`` or any
  shape with a ``text_frame``; emits one entrance effect per paragraph,
  each targeting ``<p:txEl>/<p:pRg st=N end=N/>`` so PowerPoint reveals
  paragraphs one at a time.  The first paragraph fires on the supplied
  trigger and subsequent paragraphs on ``Trigger.AFTER_PREVIOUS``.
  Available presets: ``appear``, ``fade``, ``wipe``, ``zoom``, ``wheel``,
  ``random_bars``.  The ``by_paragraph=`` keyword is also exposed on
  ``SlideAnimations.add_entrance`` for advanced use.
- ``Theme`` writer (Phase 7): ``prs.theme`` is now read/write.
  ``theme.colors[MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_1] = RGBColor(0xFF, 0x66, 0x00)``
  rewrites the requested ``clrScheme`` slot with a fresh ``<a:srgbClr>``;
  alias slots (``BACKGROUND_1``/``BACKGROUND_2``/``TEXT_1``/``TEXT_2``)
  resolve to their canonical ``lt1``/``lt2``/``dk1``/``dk2`` target.
  ``theme.fonts.major = "Inter"`` and ``theme.fonts.minor = "Inter"``
  rewrite the ``<a:majorFont>/<a:minorFont>/<a:latin typeface=…/>``
  typeface.  ``theme.apply(other_prs.theme)`` bulk-copies the palette
  and font pair.  ``theme.name`` is now writable.  Themes are loaded
  via a typed ``ThemePart(XmlPart)`` so writes round-trip on save.
- ``Cell.borders`` (Phase 4): per-edge line formatting on table cells.
  ``cell.borders.left``/``.right``/``.top``/``.bottom``/``.diagonal_down``/
  ``.diagonal_up`` each return a ``LineFormat``. Convenience helpers
  ``cell.borders.all(width=, color=)``, ``cell.borders.outer(...)``, and
  ``cell.borders.none()`` apply or clear border settings across multiple
  edges in one call. Backed by the OOXML ``a:lnL/lnR/lnT/lnB/lnTlToBr/
  lnBlToTr`` children of ``a:tcPr``.
- ``run.hyperlink.target_slide`` (Phase 4): assign a ``Slide`` to make
  a text run an internal hyperlink. Writes a relationship-based
  ``ppaction://hlinksldjump`` action; assigning ``None`` clears it. The
  symmetric getter resolves the relationship back to the target slide,
  mirroring ``Shape.click_action.target_slide``.
- ``ColorFormat.alpha`` (Phase 3): per-color transparency. Read/write
  float in ``[0.0, 1.0]`` (``1.0`` is fully opaque, the default; ``0.0``
  is fully transparent). Maps to the ``<a:alpha>`` child of any
  ``<a:srgbClr>``/``<a:schemeClr>``/etc. Available on the lazy proxy
  returned by ``Font.color`` and ``LineFormat.color`` with the same
  non-mutating read semantics as the rest of that proxy.
- ``LineFormat`` line-style additions (Phase 6): ``line.cap``
  (``MSO_LINE_CAP``: ``FLAT``/``ROUND``/``SQUARE``), ``line.compound``
  (``MSO_LINE_COMPOUND``: single, double, thick-thin, thin-thick,
  triple), ``line.join`` (``MSO_LINE_JOIN``: round/bevel/miter mapping
  to the ``<a:round/>``/``<a:bevel/>``/``<a:miter/>`` children), plus
  ``line.head_end`` and ``line.tail_end`` ``LineEndFormat`` proxies
  exposing ``.type`` (``MSO_LINE_END_TYPE``), ``.width`` and
  ``.length`` (``MSO_LINE_END_SIZE``). All reads are non-mutating;
  clearing the last attribute on a head/tail end drops the element so
  theme inheritance is preserved.
- ``Slide.transition`` (Phase 4): a ``SlideTransition`` proxy exposing
  ``.kind`` (``MSO_TRANSITION_TYPE``, including PowerPoint 2010+
  ``p14`` extension transitions like ``MORPH``, ``CONVEYOR``,
  ``VORTEX``), ``.duration`` (milliseconds, via ``p14:dur`` with
  fallback mapping for the legacy ``spd`` bucket), ``.advance_on_click``
  and ``.advance_after``. Reads on a slide with no explicit
  ``<p:transition>`` return ``None`` and never mutate; ``.clear()``
  removes the element entirely.
- ``Presentation.set_transition`` (Phase 4): deck-wide convenience that
  applies the same transition (or partial update) to every slide in a
  single call. Accepts ``kind``, ``duration``, ``advance_on_click``,
  and ``advance_after``; unspecified arguments are left untouched on
  each slide so callers can bump the duration without disturbing the
  kind. Passing ``kind=None`` removes the ``<p:transition>`` element
  on every slide.
- ``BaseShape.blur`` and ``BaseShape.reflection`` (Phase 3): two
  additional non-mutating effect proxies. ``shape.blur`` exposes
  ``.radius`` (EMU) and ``.grow``; ``shape.reflection`` exposes
  ``.blur_radius``, ``.distance``, ``.direction``, ``.start_alpha``,
  and ``.end_alpha``. Reads on a shape with no explicit effect return
  ``None`` and never mutate the XML; the underlying ``<a:blur>`` /
  ``<a:reflection>`` element is created on first write and dropped
  again when the last explicit attribute is cleared, preserving theme
  inheritance.
- New OOXML element classes ``CT_BlurEffect``, ``CT_InnerShadowEffect``,
  and ``CT_ReflectionEffect`` (Phase 3) registered for ``<a:blur>``,
  ``<a:innerShdw>``, and ``<a:reflection>`` so PowerPoint-authored
  effects round-trip without loss even when no high-level proxy is
  used.

  embedded as a shape on a slide. The OLE object is represented as an icon.


0.6.18 (2019-05-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- .text property getters encode line-break as a vertical-tab (VT, '\v', ASCII 11/x0B).
  This is consistent with PowerPoint's copy/paste behavior and allows like-breaks (soft
  carriage-return) to be distinguished from paragraph boundary. Previously, a line-break
  was encoded as a newline ('\n') and was not distinguishable from a paragraph boundary.

  .text properties include Shape.text, _Cell.text, TextFrame.text, _Paragraph.text and
  _Run.text.

- .text property setters accept vertical-tab character and place a line-break element in
  that location. All other control characters other than horizontal-tab ('\t') and
  newline ('\n') in range \x00-\x1F are accepted and escaped with plain-text like
  "_x001B" for ESC (ASCII 27).

  Previously a control character other than tab or newline in an assigned string would
  trigger an exception related to invalid XML character.

**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**

Some changes were made to the boilerplate XML used to create new charts. This
was done to more closely adhere to the settings PowerPoint uses when creating
a chart using the UI. This may result in some appearance changes in charts
after upgrading. In particular:

* Chart.has_legend now defaults to True for Line charts.
* Plot.vary_by_categories now defaults to False for Line charts.

placeholder shapes. Previously, some placeholder shapes reported
`MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.AUTO_SHAPE`, `MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.CHART`,
`MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.PICTURE`, or `MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.TABLE` for that property.

0.5.0 (2014-09-13)
++++++++++++++++++

- Add support for creating and manipulating bar, column, line, and pie charts
- Major refactoring of XML layer (oxml)
- Rationalized graphical object shape access
  **Note backward incompatibilities below**

**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**

A table is no longer treated as a shape. Rather it is a graphical object
contained in a GraphicFrame shape, as are Chart and SmartArt objects.

Example::

    table = shapes.add_table(...)

    # becomes

    graphic_frame = shapes.add_table(...)
    table = graphic_frame.table

    # or

    table = shapes.add_table(...).table

As the enclosing shape, the id, name, shape type, position, and size are
attributes of the enclosing GraphicFrame object.

The contents of a GraphicFrame shape can be identified using three available
properties on a shape: has_table, has_chart, and has_smart_art. The enclosed
graphical object is obtained using the properties GraphicFrame.table and
GraphicFrame.chart. SmartArt is not yet supported. Accessing one of these
properties on a GraphicFrame not containing the corresponding object raises
an exception.
