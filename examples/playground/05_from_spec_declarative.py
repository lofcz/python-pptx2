"""Playground 05 — Declarative authoring with ``from_spec``.

A short five-slide deck built almost entirely from a single dict spec,
demonstrating ``pptx2.compose.from_spec`` with built-in recipes,
deck-wide theme tokens, lint-as-spec-field, and per-slide transitions.

Companion to the imperative decks in this folder — useful to compare
"spec-driven, no Python boilerplate" against "direct shape construction".

Per the recipes' contract, this deck uses the SUNSET tokens declared in
``_brand.py``.  ``from_spec`` accepts a ``DesignTokens`` instance, an
inline dict, a preset name, or a YAML path; this script passes the
already-built ``SUNSET`` object directly (post-IMPROVEMENTS #8).

# Post-IMPROVEMENTS-#8, ``from_spec`` accepts an already-built

# imperative recipes and ``from_spec`` keeps the brand palette in one
# source of truth — no round-tripping through ``.to_dict()``.
