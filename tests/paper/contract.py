"""Contract-harness utilities implementing the five contract assertions.

Every mutating paper API must pass, on the relevant fixtures:

1. Save → reopen (never assert on the in-memory object): `save_reopen()`.
2. Intended effect present in the reopened document: caller asserts on the reopened object.
3. Changed-part budget: `diff_zip_members()` / `assert_changed_parts()` — the package diff
   between two outputs shows exactly the expected members changed and nothing else.
4. Independent-loader smoke: `tests.paper.lo` (marked `lo_smoke`, skipped without soffice).
5. Refusal atomicity: `assert_refusal_atomic()` (in-memory tree unchanged) and
   `assert_file_bytes_unchanged()` (files on disk unchanged), plus the typed refusal.

Comparison here is deliberately BYTE-level per zip member. Byte-compare can never call two
different parts "the same", so it can never mask a real change; semantic XML comparison is the
package kernel's job and is not test infrastructure. Because upstream `save()` stamps wall-clock
times into zip *entry headers* (not member bytes), budgets must always compare two save outputs
member-by-member — never whole-file bytes, and never a save output against the original input
file (re-serialization makes every XML part differ from the original bytes).
