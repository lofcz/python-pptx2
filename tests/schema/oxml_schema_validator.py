"""Validate generated ``.pptx`` parts against the ISO/IEC 29500 XSD schemas.

PowerPoint rejects (and silently "repairs") files that violate the OOXML
schema even when ``lxml`` / python-pptx / LibreOffice happily accept them — an
empty ``<a:scene3d>``, a colour-less ``<a:outerShdw>``, a negative chart
``axId``, a bare ``<p14:morph>``, and so on.  Those bugs are invisible to the
normal "does it parse / does it reopen" checks, so this module validates the
XML of each generated part against the schemas the repo already ships in
``spec/ISO-IEC-29500-4/xsd``.

Usage from a test::

    from tests.schema.oxml_schema_validator import (
        schema_validation_available,
        iter_schema_violations,
    )

    violations = list(iter_schema_violations(pptx_bytes_or_path))
    assert not violations, violations

The validator is deliberately conservative: it only checks the parts whose
root namespace it has a schema for (PresentationML slides/layouts/masters/notes
+ presentation.xml, DrawingML themes, chart parts, and the docProps/custom.xml
custom-properties part) and resolves
``mc:AlternateContent`` to its ``mc:Fallback`` first — the ISO-pure branch a
non-extension processor would use — so Microsoft-namespace extensions (p14
morph, etc.) are validated through their fallback rather than reported as
"unexpected".
