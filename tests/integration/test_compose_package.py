"""Integration tests for the ``pptx2.compose`` package.

These guard the public surface that Phase 7 promises:
``from_spec`` / ``import_slide`` / ``apply_template`` are all importable
from the same module path.  The implementations themselves are exercised
by their own dedicated test suites; this file just locks in re-exports.
