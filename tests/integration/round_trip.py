"""Round-trip diff harness for python-pptx2.

Save a deck, reopen it, save it again, and assert that no XML part has changed
between the two saves. Per the project roadmap, this is the gate every later
phase ships behind: any change that loses or reorders XML is a regression.

The harness canonicalizes XML before comparison (so attribute order and
insignificant whitespace don't trigger false positives) and compares non-XML
parts (e.g. embedded images) byte-for-byte.
