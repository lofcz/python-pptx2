## What this project is

**python-pptx2** is a fork of
[`power-pptx`](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/power-pptx) and, through it, of
[`python-pptx`](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx) by Steve Canny. It is a
pure-Python library for creating, reading, and updating PowerPoint 2007+
(`.pptx`) files without needing Microsoft PowerPoint installed.

- Distributed on PyPI as **`python-pptx2`** and imported as **`import pptx2`**,
  so it can sit beside upstream `python-pptx` (`pptx`) and the parent
  `power-pptx` (`power_pptx`). When migrating, replace those imports with
  `pptx2`.
- Current version is defined in `src/pptx2/__init__.py` (`__version__`).
- Python 3.9–3.13 supported. Runtime deps: `Pillow`, `XlsxWriter`, `lxml`,
  `typing_extensions`.

### Why the fork exists: space-aware authoring

The headline feature is making programmatically-generated decks **physically
correct** — text that doesn't overflow its box, shapes that don't slide off the
edges. Three layered tools catch nearly all real-world layout issues:

1. `TextFrame.fit_text(...)` — measures with Pillow font metrics and bakes a
   fitting size into the XML *before* save.
2. `text_frame.auto_size = MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE` — lets PowerPoint
   shrink at render time as a fallback.
3. `slide.lint()` / `slide.tidy()` — catches and auto-fixes what slipped
   through (e.g. nudges off-slide shapes back inside).

## ⭐ Using the library: read the bundled skill first

This repo ships its own **Claude skill** which is the canonical, up-to-date
guide for *using* the library's public API. When a task involves generating,
mutating, theming, linting, or rendering decks, consult it before writing code:

- `src/pptx2/skill/SKILL.md` — cheat sheet, common operations,
  anti-patterns, and pitfalls.
- `src/pptx2/skill/references/*.md` — deep dives per topic
  (`space-aware-authoring.md`, `geometry-and-arrows.md`, `charts.md`,
  `design.md`, `theme.md`, `animations.md`, `transitions.md`, `effects.md`,
  `tables.md`, `compose.md`, `render.md`, `lint.md`, `smart-art.md`,
  `three-d.md`, `end-to-end-deck.md`, `basics.md`, `picture-effects.md`).

A mirrored copy lives under `.claude/skills/python-pptx2/` so the skill is active
in this repo's Claude Code sessions. **These two copies must be kept in sync** —
the one under `src/` is what gets packaged and shipped to downstream installs
(`python -m pptx2.skill install` copies it into `~/.claude/skills/`).

```

## Development workflows

Standard Python tooling — no exotic build steps.

```bash
# setup (editable install + dev/test deps)
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Tests — three layers

```bash
pytest --cov=pptx2 tests        # unit tests, organized by source module
pytest tests/integration -v          # round-trip harness (save → open → save byte-clean)
pytest tests/schema -v               # validate generated decks against ISO 29500 XSDs
behave --stop                        # Gherkin acceptance tests under features/
```

- **Round-trip safety is a release blocker** — `tests/integration` must stay
  green on `master`.
- **Schema validation** is the gate for the "reopens fine but PowerPoint reports
  the file as broken / offers to repair it" class of bug. Add a schema test
  whenever you emit new XML.
- pytest discovers test classes named `Test`/`Describe` and functions prefixed
  `test_`/`it_`/`they_`/`but_`/`and_` (see `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in
  `pyproject.toml`). `filterwarnings = ["error"]` — warnings fail the suite.

### Lint, format, type-check

```bash
ruff check src tests                 # lint (line-length 100; rules in pyproject.toml)
ruff format src tests                # format
pyright                              # strict type-checking on src/pptx2 + tests
```

`docs/`, `lab/`, `spec/`, and `ref/` are excluded from ruff. `lab/` is
deliberately undisciplined experimental code.

### Building / docs

```bash
python -m build                      # sdist + wheel (or: make build)
make docs                            # Sphinx HTML into docs/.build/html
```

## CI gates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

A PR must keep all of these green:

1. **build** — `pytest` (with coverage) + `behave` across Python 3.9–3.13.
2. **examples-lint** — `pyflakes examples/` (no unused imports / undefined names).
3. **examples-build** — `python examples/real_world/build_all.py` smoke-builds
   all ten real-world decks end-to-end (proves the public surface didn't regress).
4. **schema-validation** — `pytest tests/schema` against bundled OOXML XSDs.

Other workflows: `release.yml` (tag + GitHub release + PyPI via OIDC;
the trusted-publisher workflow filename is `release.yml`),
`qodana_code_quality.yml`.

## Conventions

- **Line length 100** (ruff + black config).
- **`known-first-party = ["pptx2"]`** for isort import ordering.
- **No raw EMU integers in API usage** — use `BBox.from_inches(...)`,
  `Inches(...)`, `Pt(...)`. Float arithmetic on lengths is coerced at the
  setter, so expressions like `(Inches(N) - gutter) / 2` are fine.
- **Hex strings / tuples / `RGBColor` all work** anywhere a colour is accepted;
  prefer hex-string + short-name kwargs over importing enum constants.
- **Commit message prefixes** (imperative summary, body wrapped at 72 chars):
  `fix:`, `feat:`, `rfctr:`, `docs:`, `build:`/`dev:`, `test:`. Reference issues
  with `refs #123` / `fixes #123`.
- **PRs should be small** — one public-API surface per PR, with: code, unit
  tests, a round-trip test if new XML is emitted, a `HISTORY.rst` entry under
  the unreleased section, and doc updates if user-visible.

## When making changes

- Public API additions: add unit tests mirroring the source module layout, a
  round-trip test if XML changes, and a schema test if new XML is emitted.
- Update `HISTORY.rst` (unreleased section) for any user-visible change.
- If you change the library's public usage surface, update **both** the skill
  copy under `src/pptx2/skill/` and the mirror under `.claude/skills/`.
- The version is the `__version__` string in `src/pptx2/__init__.py`
  (setuptools reads it dynamically); a version bump can trigger the release
  workflow.
