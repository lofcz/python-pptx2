# python-pptx2 Roadmap

This roadmap describes the planned evolution of `python-pptx2` from
its 1.0.2 fork point through a hypothetical 2.0. It is a living document:
priorities are listed in order, but ship dates are deliberately not given
because each milestone is gated on the previous one and on community
feedback.

## North star

**Make it possible to generate genuinely beautiful PowerPoint
presentations from Python — animations, transitions, modern visual
effects, real theme support — without leaving the library and without
sacrificing the round-trip fidelity that makes `python-pptx` valuable
today.**

The OOXML element tree already supports almost everything modern users
want (effects, transitions, animations, themes); the work is to grow the
public API up to meet it, then layer a thin "design system" on top so the
*default* output looks good.

## Guiding principles

1. **Drop-in compatibility within 1.x.** `import pptx2` keeps working.
   Existing scripts produce byte-identical or visually-identical output.
   Breaking changes are batched and held for a clearly-flagged 2.0.
2. **OOXML faithful by default.** Every new feature maps to a real
   element in the schema; we do not invent semantics PowerPoint won't
   render.
3. **Round-trip safety is a release blocker.** A deck authored in
   PowerPoint, opened, mutated, and saved must not lose data. Every new
   feature ships with a round-trip regression test.
4. **High-level helpers are additive.** They sit on top of the low-level
   API; they never replace it.
5. **No corporate dependencies.** Pure Python on top of `lxml`, `Pillow`,
   `XlsxWriter`. No hosted services, no telemetry, no auth.
6. **Read should never mutate.** Getter properties are idempotent. Where
   the upstream library got this wrong, we fix it (with deprecation
   warnings where behavior actually changes).

## Versioning

| Range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1.1.x` | First active-fork release. Bug fixes only. No new API. |
| `1.2.x` – `1.9.x` | New features, additive only. No removals. |
| `2.0.0` | Breaking changes, deprecation removals, API cleanups. |

Pre-release builds use `.devN`/`.aN`/`.bN` suffixes and publish to PyPI
under the same distribution name.

## Out of scope

These items have been considered and explicitly deferred or rejected, so
contributors don't burn time prototyping them:

- **Full SmartArt creation.** The layout algorithms are proprietary and
  non-trivial to reverse-engineer. We *will* support text substitution
  inside an existing template's SmartArt (see Phase 7).
- **A separate pure-Python distribution (`python-pptx-mini`).** `lxml`
  is reliably available on every modern serverless runtime via manylinux
  wheels; the maintenance cost of a parallel distribution is not
  justified.
- **A pixel-accurate rendering engine.** The text-fit estimator (Phase 5)
  uses Pillow font metrics for "good enough" auto-fit; we do not aim to
  replicate PowerPoint's renderer.
- **Live integration with the PowerPoint application** (COM, AppleScript,
  Office.js). This library manipulates files on disk; it does not drive
  a running PowerPoint instance.
- **`.ppt` (legacy binary format) support.** Out of scope, same as
  upstream.

---

## Phase 1 — Hygiene and bug fixes (target: 1.1.0)  *— SHIPPED*

No new public API. Cleans up known issues that would otherwise compound
as we add features on top.

- [x] **Non-mutating color getters.** `Font.color` (`text/text.py:305-310`)
  and `LineFormat.color` (`dml/line.py:21-33`) currently call
  `self.fill.solid()` on read, silently severing theme inheritance. Fix
  by adding a non-mutating read path that returns the inherited color
  when no explicit fill is set, and only mutating on assignment. Add a
  deprecation note for the old behavior in the docstring.
- [x] **`max_shape_id` caching at the element level.** `CT_GroupShape`
  (`oxml/shapes/groupshape.py:150-163`) does an `xpath('//@id')` scan on
  every shape add, giving O(N²) over a slide. Cache the max at the
  group-shape level and invalidate on child mutation. Default fast path,
  no `turbo_add_enabled` collision risk. Keep `turbo_add_enabled` as a
  deprecated no-op for one minor version.
- [x] **`PERCENT_40` typo fix** (`enum/dml.py:253`). Currently spelled
  `ERCENT_40`. Add `PERCENT_40` as the canonical name and keep
  `ERCENT_40` as a back-compat alias with a `DeprecationWarning`.
- [x] **Drop Python 3.8.** EOL October 2024. Require 3.9+; bump
  `requires-python` and `pyright`'s `pythonVersion` accordingly.
- [x] **CI on GitHub Actions.** Replace dead `.travis.yml` with a workflow
  matrix across the supported Python versions.
- [x] **Issues & governance.** `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, an issue-template, a PR-template.
- [x] **Round-trip test harness.** Generate a deck → open in `python-pptx`
  → save → diff XML. Used by every later phase.

**Done when:** all 1.0.2 user code runs unchanged, the regression
harness is green, and the CI matrix passes on 3.9–3.13.

## Phase 2 — Layout integrity and JSON authoring (target: 1.2.0)

The first thing people notice about an auto-generated deck is bad
geometry: shapes overlap when they shouldn't, text spills out of its
container, things sit slightly off the slide. This phase makes "the
deck physically lays out correctly" a property the library can detect
and (where safe) repair, and exposes a JSON entry point so LLM-driven
generators can route straight into the linter without rewriting
boilerplate.

### [x] Linter

A read-only inspector that reports geometric and typographic issues on
a slide or whole deck.

```python
report = slide.lint()                  # SlideLintReport
report.issues                          # list[LintIssue]
report.has_errors                      # bool
report.summary()                       # human-readable string

deck_report = prs.lint()               # DeckLintReport, slide-by-slide
```

Initial issue types:

- `TextOverflow(shape, ratio)` — measured text extent exceeds the
  text-frame extent. Uses Pillow `ImageDraw.textbbox` with the run's
  font metrics; respects margins, vertical anchor, line spacing, and
  `auto_size`. Builds on the existing `TextFitter` in `text/layout.py`.
- `ShapeCollision(a, b, intersection_area, intersection_pct)` — two
  shapes' bounding boxes overlap and the overlap is not declared
  intentional (see relationship model below).
- `OffSlide(shape, side)` — shape is wholly or partly outside the slide
  bounds.
- `TextTooSmall(shape, point_size)` — body text below a configurable
  minimum (default 9pt; warning, not error).
- (stretch) `LowContrast(shape, ratio)` — text-on-fill contrast below
  WCAG 2.1 AA. Requires resolving theme colors, so depends on the
  Phase 5 theme reader; ships in 1.5.x or later.

### [x] Relationship model — declaring intentional overlaps

Without intent markers, every shadow, badge, and layered card trips
the collision detector. Three escape hatches:

1. **Group-implicit.** Shapes inside the same `<p:grpSp>` are treated
   as cooperating. Putting a badge and its underlying card in a group
   silences collisions between them.
2. **Explicit pairwise.** `shape_a.allow_overlap_with(shape_b)`. Stored
   on the shape's `<a:extLst>` under a private namespace so it
   round-trips through PowerPoint without losing the marker. Shipped
   with `disallow_overlap_with()` and an `overlap_allowances` property;
   keyed on `cNvPr/@id` rather than shape name, since only the id is
   guaranteed unique on a slide.
3. **Layer hints.** `shape.layer = "badge"`,
   `shape.layer_above = "card"`. Asserts a deliberate z-order
   relationship; the linter treats overlaps consistent with the layer
   declaration as intentional and inconsistent ones as errors — the new
   `LayerOrderViolation`, which `auto_fix()` repairs by restacking.

In JSON specs (below), all three are expressible as fields on a shape
entry, so an LLM can declare its intent at generation time.

### [x] Auto-fix

Some issues can be repaired without designer judgment; some can't.

- **`TextOverflow` → autofit.** Apply `MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`
  using a Pillow-driven sizing pass, respecting a configurable minimum
  font size. If the minimum is hit and text still overflows, downgrade
  to a `TextOverflow` warning.
- **`OffSlide` → nudge.** Translate the shape so it sits inside the
  slide. Logs an info-level note; never silent.
- **`ShapeCollision` → not auto-fixable.** Nudging shapes apart almost
  always breaks the design. Reported only.

```python
report.auto_fix()                      # mutates; returns list of fixes
report.auto_fix(dry_run=True)          # preview; no mutation
```

### [x] Validation hooks

```python
prs.lint_on_save = "off"               # default, no checks at save
prs.lint_on_save = "warn"              # log via stdlib logging
prs.lint_on_save = "raise"             # raise LintError on save
```

Off by default to preserve drop-in compatibility with 1.0.2 user code.

### [x] JSON authoring

A single entry point for generator scripts (LLM or otherwise):

```python
from pptx2 import Presentation
from pptx2.compose import from_spec

prs = from_spec({
    "theme": {"palette": "modern_blue", "fonts": "inter"},
    "slides": [
        {
            "layout": "title",
            "title": "Q4 Review",
            "subtitle": "April 2026",
            "transition": "morph",
        },
        {
            "layout": "kpi_grid",
            "title": "Run-rate metrics",
            "kpis": [
                {"label": "ARR", "value": "$182M", "delta": +0.27},
                {"label": "NDR", "value": "131%", "delta": +0.03},
            ],
        },
        {
            "layout": "bullets",
            "title": "Customer impact",
            "bullets": [
                "Two flagship customers shipped this week.",
                "NPS improved 8 points QoQ.",
            ],
        },
    ],
    "lint": "raise",                   # fail loudly on bad output
})
```

Schema is JSON-schema-validated before construction. Layout names
resolve to Phase 8 design recipes when those exist; in 1.2.0 they map
to a small built-in set of layouts using the host presentation's
master.

### What's deliberately *not* in this phase

- Theme palette resolution (Phase 5).
- The full `pptx2.design.recipes` library (Phase 8). 1.2.0 ships with
  ~5 hand-rolled layouts so `from_spec` is useful immediately.
- Live re-layout on edit. The linter inspects; it does not maintain a
  constraint graph.

### Done when

A 20-slide deck generated from a JSON spec by an LLM is run through
the linter and produces zero `error`-severity issues, and the same
linter applied to a hand-built deck flags every one of a curated set
of "real-world LLM mistakes" (text overflow, shapes off-slide, charts
stacked under titles).

---

## Phase 3 — Visual effects (target: 1.3.0)

The single highest-impact *visual* feature. The OOXML element classes
are already wired up at `oxml/shapes/shared.py:395`; we just need real
children.

- [x] **`ShadowFormat`, expanded.** `dml/effect.py:6-42` now exposes
  `blur_radius`, `distance`, `direction`, and `color` (`ColorFormat`, supports
  theme + RGB) in addition to the existing `inherit` property. All reads are
  non-mutating; the `<a:effectLst>`/`<a:outerShdw>` hierarchy is created lazily
  on first write. (`style`/`preset` enum attributes deferred — complex variant
  handling; `size`/skew attrs deferred to a follow-up.)
- [x] **New `GlowFormat`, `SoftEdgeFormat`, `BlurFormat`, `ReflectionFormat`**
  with a parallel non-mutating API.  Surfaced as `shape.glow` (radius, color),
  `shape.soft_edges` (radius), `shape.blur` (radius, grow), and
  `shape.reflection` (blur_radius, distance, direction, start_alpha,
  end_alpha).  Reflection clears its `<a:reflection>` element when the last
  explicit attribute is removed, preserving theme inheritance.
- [x] **OOXML element classes.** New `oxml/dml/effect.py` with `CT_EffectList`,
  `CT_OuterShadowEffect`, `CT_GlowEffect`, `CT_SoftEdgesEffect`,
  `CT_BlurEffect`, `CT_InnerShadowEffect`, and `CT_ReflectionEffect`. Inner
  shadow currently has no high-level proxy — the OOXML class is registered so
  PowerPoint-authored inner shadows round-trip cleanly.
- [x] **Inheritance semantics.** Reading a property on a shape with no
  explicit value returns `None`. (Theme-walking is deferred to Phase 5.)
- [x] **`RGBColor.alpha` / per-color transparency.** Adds `<a:alpha>`
  emission inside any `ColorFormat` consumer. Unlocks "glassy card"
  looks. Surfaced as `color_format.alpha` (read/write float in
  `[0.0, 1.0]`, defaulting to fully opaque); also available on the
  `_LazyColorFormat` proxy returned by `Font.color` / `LineFormat.color`,
  with the same non-mutating read semantics.
- [x] **`Font.fill`.** Tiny addition: `Font` already has access to `rPr`,
  but no public `fill`. Add it. Unblocks gradient-text and patterned
  text titles. *(Already present upstream as `Font.fill`, kept and
  documented.)*

**Done when:** a user can compose a card-style shape with custom outer
shadow + soft edge + alpha-tinted fill in five lines of Python and
PowerPoint renders it identically to a card built in the UI.

## Phase 4 — Tables and transitions (target: 1.4.0)

Two unrelated medium-effort wins, packaged together because each is
small.

- [x] **`Cell.borders`.** Today border styling requires manual XML
  injection of `<a:lnL>`, `<a:lnR>`, `<a:lnT>`, `<a:lnB>` under
  `<a:tcPr>`. Add a `Borders` value object exposing
  `cell.borders.left/right/top/bottom/diagonal_down/diagonal_up`,
  each a `LineFormat`. Add convenience: `Borders.all(...)`,
  `Borders.outer(...)`, `Borders.none()`. Fixes the single most-asked-for
  table feature.
- [x] **`Slide.transition`.** `<p:transition>` is now wired up via
  `CT_SlideTransition` and exposed as `slide.transition` (a
  `SlideTransition` proxy). Initial scope:
  - `transition.kind = MSO_TRANSITION.MORPH` — `MSO_TRANSITION_TYPE`
    enum covering 25+ kinds, including `p14:` extension transitions
    (Morph, Vortex, Conveyor, Switch, Gallery, Fly Through). The
    `p14` namespace was added to `oxml/ns.py`.
  - `transition.duration` (ms; reads/writes `p14:dur`, falls back to
    mapping the legacy `spd` bucket on read).
  - `transition.advance_on_click` (writes `advClick="0"|"1"`).
  - `transition.advance_after` (ms; writes `advTm`).
  - `transition.clear()` removes the `<p:transition>` element entirely.
  - Reads on an unset transition return `None` and never mutate XML,
    keeping theme inheritance intact.
  - [x] **Deck-wide helper.** `Presentation.set_transition(kind=...,
    duration=..., advance_on_click=..., advance_after=...)` applies the
    same transition (or partial update) to every slide in a single call.
    Unspecified kwargs are left untouched on each slide so callers can
    bump the duration without disturbing the kind.
  - Direction attributes are deferred to a follow-up.
- [x] **Run-level internal hyperlinks.** `run.hyperlink.target_slide =
  deck.slides[7]` writes a relationship-based action instead of a URI.
  Single XML attribute swap; missing today.

**Done when:** a deck can be authored with per-cell zebra-striped
borders and a Morph transition between two title slides.

## Phase 5 — Animations (target: 1.5.0)

The single most-requested feature. Largest design surface in this
roadmap. We ship the **preset subset only** — the full timing tree is
expressive enough to break PowerPoint, and 90% of users want one of a
dozen entrance presets.

- [x] **`pptx2.animation` module.** New top-level public module with
  `Entrance`, `Exit`, `Emphasis`, and `SlideAnimations` classes.
  Accessible via `slide.animations`.
- [x] **Trigger model.** `Trigger.ON_CLICK` /
  `Trigger.WITH_PREVIOUS` / `Trigger.AFTER_PREVIOUS`, with `delay`.
  Implemented in `pptx2/enum/animation.py` as `PP_ANIM_TRIGGER`;
  `Trigger` alias exported from `pptx2.animation`.
- [x] **Entrance presets.** 8 presets: Appear, Fade, Fly In (4
  directions), Float In, Wipe, Zoom, Wheel, Random Bars. Each maps
  to a known `presetID` in the `<p:par>/<p:cTn>` tree.
- [x] **Emphasis presets.** Pulse, Spin, Teeter — using `<p:animScale>`,
  `<p:animRot>` behaviors.
- [x] **Exit presets.** Disappear, Fade, Fly Out, Float Out, Wipe, Zoom
  (mirror of entrance with `presetClass="exit"` and `transition="out"`).
- [x] **Round-trip preservation.** New effects are appended to the
  existing timing tree without touching any pre-existing `<p:par>` nodes;
  PowerPoint-authored animations survive a read-modify-write cycle intact.
- [x] **Motion paths.** `MotionPath.line(slide, shape, dx, dy)` accepts
  EMU deltas and normalizes them against the slide's dimensions before
  emitting the path attribute; `MotionPath.custom(slide, shape,
  path_str)` passes an OOXML motion-path expression through verbatim.
  Both effects route through `SlideAnimations.add_motion`, share the
  Phase 5 trigger model, and round-trip cleanly.
- [x] **Sequencing.** `with slide.animations.sequence(start=...): ...`
  context manager defaults the first contained effect to *start* (or
  `Trigger.ON_CLICK`) and subsequent effects to
  `Trigger.AFTER_PREVIOUS`, so a chain of presets fires from a single
  click.  Explicit per-call triggers still win.  Sequences cannot be
  nested.
- [x] **By-paragraph animation.** `Entrance.fade(slide, text_frame,
  by_paragraph=True)` (also accepts a shape with a `text_frame`) emits
  one entrance effect per paragraph using `<p:txEl>/<p:pRg>` targeting,
  chained with `Trigger.AFTER_PREVIOUS` so paragraphs reveal one at a
  time.  Currently supports `appear`, `fade`, `wipe`, `zoom`, `wheel`,
  and `random_bars` — direction-aware presets remain a follow-up.

**Done when:** a generated 10-slide deck with on-click bullet reveals
plays in PowerPoint identically to one assembled in the UI, and a deck
authored in PowerPoint with custom animations is round-tripped without
loss.

## Phase 6 — Theme, picture effects, advanced fills (target: 1.6.0)

- [x] **Read-only theme API.** `prs.theme.colors[MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_1]`
  resolves to `RGBColor`; `prs.theme.fonts.major` / `.minor` return font
  names. New `pptx2/theme.py` module (`Theme`, `ThemeColors`, `ThemeFonts`)
  on top of the expanded `oxml/theme.py`. Wired into `Presentation.theme`
  and `SlideMasterPart.theme`.
- [x] **Theme-aware inheritance** for effect/color getters from Phase 2.
  New `pptx2.inherit.resolve_color(color_format, theme=prs.theme)` helper
  returns the effective `RGBColor` for any `ColorFormat` (including the
  `_LazyColorFormat` proxy on `Font.color` / `LineFormat.color`):
  explicit RGB colors are returned as-is, scheme colors resolve through
  `theme.colors[…]`, and unset colors return `None` without mutating XML.
  `brightness` is applied by blending the resolved RGB toward white or
  black, mirroring PowerPoint's `lumMod`/`lumOff` model.  Full
  placeholder-walking (`slide → layout → master`) is intentionally
  deferred to a follow-up — this resolver covers the 80% case
  (theme-color lookup) without touching XML.
- [x] **Picture effects.** `Picture.transparency`, `.brightness`,
  `.contrast`, `.recolor` (grayscale, sepia, washout, duotone). Maps to
  `<a:lum>`, `<a:alphaModFix>`, `<a:duotone>`, `<a:biLevel>`,
  `<a:grayscl>` inside `<a:blip>`.  Exposed via `picture.effects`
  (`PictureEffects` proxy in `pptx2/dml/picture.py`).  `set_duotone()`
  accepts `RGBColor`, hex strings, or RGB 3-tuples.
- [x] **Native SVG in `add_picture`.** New
  `slide.shapes.add_svg_picture(svg_file, left, top, width=None,
  height=None, *, png_fallback=None)` embeds both an
  `<asvg:svgBlip>` (Office 2016+ SVG extension) and a PNG fallback
  inside the same `<a:blip>`, so PowerPoint and earlier viewers
  render the right thing.  When `png_fallback` is omitted the SVG
  is rasterised via the optional `cairosvg` dependency, with a
  clear `CairoSvgUnavailable` error guiding callers to install it
  or supply their own fallback.  New `image/svg+xml` content type is
  registered with the package so SVG parts round-trip through
  PowerPoint untouched.  Helper module: `pptx2/_svg.py`
  (`looks_like_svg`, `rasterize_svg`, `add_svg_image_part`,
  `add_svg_blip_extension`).
- [x] **Radial / rectangular / path-shape gradients.** `FillFormat.gradient`
  now accepts a `kind` argument (``"linear" | "radial" | "rectangular" |
  "shape"``) and exposes the resolved value via `fill.gradient_kind`.
  Switching kinds preserves the existing gradient stops and only swaps
  the `<a:lin>`/`<a:path>` shading element.  `GradientStops` is now
  mutable: `stops.append(position, color)`, `stops.replace([(pos, color),
  ...])`, and `del stops[i]` (the OOXML 2-stop minimum is enforced).
  Colors accept `RGBColor`, hex strings (with or without leading `#`),
  3-tuples, or `None` (placeholder `accent1`).
- [x] **Line ends, caps, joins, compound lines.** `line.head_end`,
  `line.tail_end` (each a `LineEndFormat` exposing `.type`, `.width`,
  `.length`), `line.cap` (`MSO_LINE_CAP`), `line.compound`
  (`MSO_LINE_COMPOUND`), and `line.join` (`MSO_LINE_JOIN`, mapping to
  `<a:round/>` / `<a:bevel/>` / `<a:miter/>`). Reads are non-mutating;
  setting an end attribute lazily creates `<a:ln>`/`<a:headEnd>` and
  clearing the last attribute drops the end element again so theme
  inheritance is preserved.
- [x] **Text fit estimator.** Pillow-driven measurement so
  `TextFrame.fit_text` works without requiring a `font_file=` argument
  in the common case.  `FontFiles._font_directories()` now also
  enumerates Linux paths (`/usr/share/fonts`, `/usr/local/share/fonts`,
  `~/.fonts`, `~/.local/share/fonts`) and returns `[]` on unrecognised
  platforms instead of raising `OSError`.  When no matching system font
  can be located, the estimator falls back to Pillow's bundled default
  font (`ImageFont.load_default(size=...)` on Pillow ≥10.1, otherwise
  the unsized bitmap default), so `fit_text()` produces a usable size
  on bare runtimes (CI, serverless, minimal Docker images) instead of
  raising `KeyError` / `OSError`.  Malformed font files are skipped
  during the directory scan.

**Done when:** a generated deck honors a brand color palette read from
the theme, recolors photos to match it, and embeds vector logos at
print resolution.

## Phase 7 — Slide composition and theme writer (target: 1.7.0)

Solves "I want to merge decks" — the JSON entry point already shipped
in Phase 2, but cross-presentation operations are the remaining piece.

- [x] **`pptx2.compose` package** (extending the module introduced in
  Phase 2 for `from_spec`).  Now a real package: `pptx2.compose`
  re-exports `from_spec`, `import_slide`, and `apply_template` from a
  single import path so callers can do `from pptx2.compose import
  from_spec, import_slide, apply_template`.  The implementations
  remain in private submodules (`pptx2.compose.from_spec`,
  `pptx2._slide_importer`, `pptx2._template_applier`) so the public
  surface stays small.
- [x] **`import_slide(other_slide, *, merge_master='dedupe' | 'clone')`.**
  Clones a slide from another presentation, including its layout
  reference, with master-deduplication and image-rename collision
  handling. Closes the upstream issues that today force users into
  Aspose/Spire.
- [x] **`apply_template(potx_or_pptx)`.** Re-points slides at masters/layouts
  imported from a `.potx` or `.pptx`.
- [x] **Theme writer.** `prs.theme.colors[MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_1] =
  RGBColor(...)` writes a fresh `<a:srgbClr>` into the requested
  clrScheme slot (alias slots like `BACKGROUND_1` resolve to their
  canonical `lt1`/`lt2`/`dk1`/`dk2` target).  `prs.theme.fonts.major =
  "Inter"` and `prs.theme.fonts.minor = "Inter"` rewrite the
  `<a:majorFont>/<a:minorFont>/<a:latin typeface=…/>` typeface, and
  `prs.theme.apply(other_prs.theme)` bulk-copies the palette and font
  pair from another theme.  Themes are now loaded as a typed
  `ThemePart(XmlPart)` so writes round-trip on save.

**Done when:** `Presentation.import_slide(prs2.slides[3])` produces a
result indistinguishable from drag-and-drop in PowerPoint, and a brand
theme can be swapped in from a `.potx` in one call.

## Phase 8 — 3D, SmartArt text substitution (target: 1.8.0)

- [x] **3D primitives.** Bevels (`a:bevelT`/`a:bevelB`) and extrusion
  (`a:sp3d`) under a new `shape.three_d` accessor. The `<a:scene3d>`
  / `<a:sp3d>` slots are already reserved at
  `oxml/shapes/shared.py:368-369`.
- [x] **SmartArt text substitution.** `slide.smart_art[0].set_text(['NY',
  'CA', 'TX'])` rewrites the text-list inside an *existing*
  `diagrams/data1.xml` without touching the layout. Bounded scope —
  full SmartArt creation remains explicitly out.

**Done when:** a corporate org-chart template can be re-populated with
fresh names entirely from Python, and a "card" shape can render with
bevel + soft shadow in three lines.

## Phase 9 — Design system layer (target: 1.9.0)

The piece that turns the low-level API into something where the
*default* output looks good. Nothing here adds new XML — it's all on
top of the foundations from earlier phases.

- [x] **`pptx2.design.tokens.DesignTokens`.** Palette, typography, radii,
  shadows, spacings.  Lives in `pptx2/design/tokens.py` with
  `TypographyToken` and `ShadowToken` value objects.  Sources:
  - `DesignTokens.from_dict(...)` — the canonical form; coerces hex
    strings, RGB 3-tuples, and bare floats (treated as points) into
    `RGBColor` / `Length`.
  - `DesignTokens.from_yaml('brand.yml')` — optional `pyyaml`
    dependency, with a clear `ImportError` hint when missing.
  - `DesignTokens.from_pptx('template.pptx')` (extracts the six accent
    slots, `dk1`/`dk2`/`lt1`/`lt2`/hyperlink slots, and major/minor
    fonts from `theme.xml`).
  - `merge(other)` for layering brand-spec overrides on top of a
    template-extracted base.
- [x] **`shape.style`.** Token-resolving facade in
  `pptx2/design/style.py` (`ShapeStyle`).  Setters: `style.fill =
  tokens.palette['primary']`, `style.line = ...`, `style.shadow =
  tokens.shadows['card']`, `style.text_color = ...`, `style.font =
  tokens.typography['body']`.  Internally fans assignments out to
  `fill` / `line` / `shadow` / per-run font, leaving unset shadow
  fields untouched so partial tokens are non-destructive.  Exposed via
  `BaseShape.style`.
- [x] **`pptx2.design.layout`.** `Grid(slide, cols=12, rows=6, gutter=Pt(12),
  margin=...)` allocates `Box(left, top, width, height)` rectangles for any
  cell or span (`grid.cell(col, row, col_span, row_span)`); `grid.place(
  shape, ...)` writes them onto a shape.  `Stack(direction="vertical" |
  "horizontal", gap=Pt(8), left=..., top=..., width=..., height=...)`
  exposes a running cursor via `stack.next(width=..., height=...)` /
  `stack.place(shape, ...)`, with `stack.reset()` to rewind.  Pure
  build-time geometry — no XML is read or mutated until a `place()` call.
- [x] **`pptx2.design.recipes`.** Opinionated parameterized slide
  constructors shipped as plain functions in `pptx2/design/recipes.py`:
  `title_slide`, `bullet_slide`, `kpi_slide`, `quote_slide`, and
  `image_hero_slide`.  Each consumes a `DesignTokens` (palette +
  typography + optional `card` shadow), places shapes through the
  existing `add_shape` / `add_textbox` / `add_picture` APIs, applies
  styling via `shape.style`, and accepts an optional `transition=`
  kwarg.  Recipes that touch a `kpi_slide`'s delta colors honor
  `palette["positive"]` / `palette["negative"]`, falling back to a
  green/red default when unset; `image_hero_slide` uses
  `palette["on_primary"]` for the overlay text and tints the bottom
  band with `palette["primary"]` at 55% alpha.
- [x] **A small published "starter pack"** — three example token sets
  (Modern, Classic, Editorial) under `examples/starter_pack/`, each
  exporting both `SPEC` (the raw dict) and `TOKENS` (a built
  `DesignTokens`).  `examples/starter_pack/build_preview.py` renders
  one preview deck per set (title + bullets + KPI + quote) so callers
  can compare them side-by-side; the generated `.pptx` files land in
  `examples/starter_pack/_out/` (gitignored).

**Done when:** a user can `pip install python-pptx2`, copy 30 lines
from the README, and produce a deck that wouldn't look out of place in
a series-A pitch.

## Phase 10 — Stretch / community (target: 1.10.0+)

Items that are valuable but not on the critical path:

- [x] **Chart palette presets independent of `chart_style`.**
  `Chart.apply_palette(palette)` recolors every series in a chart from a
  named built-in preset (``modern``, ``classic``, ``editorial``,
  ``vibrant``, ``monochrome_blue``, ``monochrome_warm``) or an iterable
  of color-likes (`RGBColor`, hex strings with or without `#`, or
  `(r, g, b)` triples).  Series are recolored in declaration order;
  palettes wrap when the chart has more series than colors.  The
  `chart_style` integer is left untouched, so the palette overrides only
  the per-series fill without rewriting the rest of the style.  New
  module: `pptx2/chart/palettes.py` exposes `CHART_PALETTES`,
  `palette_names()`, and `resolve_palette()` for callers that want to
  share the same color set with non-chart shapes.
- [x] **Per-series chart fills (gradient/pattern) via `ChartFormat`.**
  `chart.series[i].format.fill` is a full `FillFormat`, so all gradient
  kinds (`linear` / `radial` / `rectangular` / `shape`) and pattern
  fills (`MSO_PATTERN_TYPE`) work per-series with no chart-specific
  shim.  Locked in with regression tests in
  `tests/chart/test_chart.py`.
- [x] **Chart "quick layouts" (mirroring PowerPoint's gallery).**
  `Chart.apply_quick_layout(layout)` toggles title / legend / axis-title /
  gridline visibility in opinionated combinations.  Ten built-in
  presets ship in `pptx2.chart.quick_layouts` (`title_legend_right`,
  `title_legend_bottom`, `title_legend_top`, `title_legend_left`,
  `title_no_legend`, `no_title_no_legend`, `title_axes_legend_right`,
  `title_axes_legend_bottom`, `minimal`, `dense`); custom layouts can be
  supplied as a dict spec.  Missing spec keys leave the chart untouched
  so layouts compose cleanly, and charts without category/value axes
  (e.g. pie) silently skip the corresponding keys.
- [x] Additional motion-path presets.  `MotionPath` now exposes
  `diagonal`, `circle` (closed cubic-bezier loop, with a `clockwise`
  flag), `arc` (quadratic-bezier hop with configurable `height`),
  `zigzag` (configurable `segments` and `amplitude`), and `spiral`
  (configurable `turns` and direction) in addition to the existing
  `line` / `custom` constructors.  All presets normalize their EMU
  inputs against the slide's dimensions and route through the same
  `slide.animations.add_motion` plumbing as `MotionPath.line`, so they
  honor the Phase 5 trigger model and round-trip cleanly.
- [x] **Slide-thumbnail renderer (LibreOffice shell-out).** New
  `pptx2.render` module with `render_slide_thumbnails(prs, ...)` and
  `render_slide_thumbnail(slide, ...)`, plus convenience methods
  `Presentation.render_thumbnails()` and `Slide.render_thumbnail()`.
  Drives `soffice --headless --convert-to png` to rasterise slides;
  supports custom binary path (via the `soffice_bin=` argument or
  `POWER_PPTX_SOFFICE` env var), per-slide selection (`slide_indexes=`),
  bytes-or-paths return (`return_bytes=True`), custom output directory,
  and a configurable timeout.  Raises
  `ThumbnailRendererUnavailable` with an install hint when `soffice`
  isn't on PATH and `ThumbnailRendererError` on conversion failure.
- [x] **Documentation site rebuild.** Sphinx config rewritten for the
  fork (modern theme, refreshed substitution table, ``fail_on_warning``
  on Read-the-Docs); ``README.rst`` rewritten around the new feature
  set; ``docs/index.rst`` reorganised; new user-guide chapters added
  for visual effects, animations, transitions, the layout linter,
  composition, themes, the design-system layer, advanced charts, and
  slide thumbnails; new API-reference pages added for ``pptx2.animation``,
  ``pptx2.lint``, ``pptx2.compose``, ``pptx2.theme`` (plus
  ``pptx2.inherit.resolve_color``), ``pptx2.design`` (tokens, style,
  layout, recipes), ``pptx2.render``, and ``pptx2.smart_art``; the
  ``DrawingML`` reference page now covers the full Phase 3/6 effect
  family; new enum pages cover ``MSO_LINE_CAP_STYLE``,
  ``MSO_LINE_COMPOUND_STYLE``, ``MSO_LINE_JOIN_STYLE``,
  ``MSO_LINE_END_TYPE``, ``MSO_LINE_END_SIZE``,
  ``MSO_TRANSITION_TYPE``, and ``PP_ANIM_TRIGGER``.

## Phase 11 — 2.0.0 (the breaking-changes release)

Everything that's been accumulating deprecation warnings through 1.x
gets removed.  Phase 11 is intentionally a *2.0* release — these
removals are tracked here so the deprecation surface is visible, but
they cannot be checked off on the 1.x line:

- `ShadowFormat.inherit` — replaced by reading individual properties
  for `None`. Removed.
- `ERCENT_40` typo alias — removed.
- `turbo_add_enabled` no-op — removed.
- `Font.color` mutating-on-read fallback (kept under a deprecation flag
  in 1.x for users who depended on the old behavior) — removed.
- [x] `RGBColor.from_hex("#3C2F80")` **added** (accepts strings with or
  without `#`).  `RGBColor.from_string("3C2F80")` is kept as-is in 1.x;
  it will be removed in 2.0 in favour of `from_hex`.
- Drop Python versions that hit EOL during 1.x.

No new features in 2.0; it's a cleanup release. New features land in
2.1.

### 1.x readiness for the 2.0 cut (shipped in 1.1.0)

These are the 1.x-line preparations that make the 2.0 removals
mechanical when the time comes:

- [x] `ShadowFormat.inherit` emits a `DeprecationWarning` on both read
  and write, with a message pointing callers at the per-property
  reads.  Tests assert the warning fires.
- [x] `MSO_PATTERN_TYPE.ERCENT_40` is wired through the
  `_DeprecatingEnumMeta` machinery and emits a `DeprecationWarning`
  on access, with `PERCENT_40` as the canonical name.
- [x] `shapes.turbo_add_enabled` setter emits a `DeprecationWarning`
  noting that shape-id allocation is now always O(1).
- [x] `Font.color` was switched to a non-mutating `_LazyColorFormat`
  proxy in Phase 1; the upstream behavior of inserting an empty
  `<a:solidFill>` on read is gone in 1.x, so the 2.0 removal is just
  documentation cleanup (no flag is needed).
- [x] `RGBColor.from_hex` already shipped (Phase 11 row above).

## Lint follow-ups (post-2.1.1)  *— SHIPPED in 2.2.0*

Both detector-model items from the post-2.1.1 follow-up landed in
**2.2.0**.  See the HISTORY entry for details.

- [x] **`ShapeCollision` structural-vs-incidental scoring.**
  ``ShapeCollision`` now carries a ``score: float`` and
  ``kind: "incidental" | "partial" | "matched"``, with severity
  tiered off ``kind`` (INFO / WARNING / ERROR).  Lint-group
  suppression runs before scoring, since a tagged group is
  intentional by definition.  Surfaced in ``report.summary()`` as
  ``[kind=…, score=…]``.  *(commit
  `2c2f48b feat(lint): structural-vs-incidental scoring on
  ShapeCollision`)*
- [x] **Effect-bleed-aware geometry in OffSlide / ShapeCollision.**
  Opt-in via ``slide.lint(include_effect_bleed=True)``; widens each
  shape's bbox by ``shadow.blur_radius / 2`` before the geometry
  checks run.  Bleed-only triggers come back as new ``OffSlideShadow``
  / ``ShapeCollisionShadow`` subclasses so callers can opt out
  specifically via ``shape.lint_skip``.  ``GraphicFrame.shadow ==
  None`` is handled gracefully.  *(commit
  `31c5426 feat(lint): effect-bleed-aware geometry in OffSlide /
  ShapeCollision`)*

Deliberately deferred to a follow-up:

- Exposing the scoring thresholds as ``slide.lint(...)`` kwargs for
  callers who want to retune them without re-implementing the
  detector.
- Replacing the simple ``blur_radius / 2`` inflation with a
  directional projection that respects ``distance × direction``.
- Wiring glow / soft-edges / reflection into ``_effective_bbox`` —
  same pattern, different effect element.

## How to follow / contribute

- **Issues**: GitHub issue tracker on the fork repository.
- **Roadmap discussion**: each phase gets a tracking meta-issue once the
  previous phase is in beta.
- **PR scope**: small. Each public API surface from the phases above
  should be its own PR with tests, docs, and a HISTORY entry.
- **What we say no to**: features that require non-trivial new
  dependencies, features that don't round-trip cleanly, and anything in
  the "out of scope" list above without a strong new argument.

This document will be updated each release with what actually shipped
and what slipped. The dates are deliberately absent; the order is the
commitment.
